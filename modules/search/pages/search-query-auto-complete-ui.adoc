[abstract]
{description}

== Prerequisites 

* You have the Search Service enabled on a node in your database.
For more information about how to deploy a new node and Services on your database, see xref:server:manage:manage-nodes/node-management-overview.adoc[].

* You have a bucket with scopes and collections in your database.
For more information about how to create a bucket, see xref:server:manage:manage-buckets/create-bucket.adoc[].

* Your user account has the *Search Admin* role for the bucket where you want to create the index. 

* You have logged in to the Couchbase {page-ui-name}. 
 

== Procedure 

You can create a compatible Search index with the <<ui,Web Console>> or the <<api,REST API>>.  

[#ui]
=== Create the Autocomplete Search Index with the Web Console

To create the Search index with the Web Console:

. Go to *Search*.
. Click btn:[Add Index].
. In the *Index Name* field, enter a name for the new index. 
+
[NOTE]
====
Your index name must start with an alphabetic character (a-z or A-Z). It can only contain alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, or 0-9), hyphens (-), or underscores (_).

For Couchbase Server version 7.6 and later, your index name must be unique inside your selected bucket and scope. 
You cannot have 2 indexes with the same name inside the same bucket and scope.
====
. In the *Bucket* list, select the bucket where you want to create the index. 
. Expand *Customize Index*. 
. Select *Use non-default scope/collection(s)*. 
. In the *Scope* list, select the scope where you want to create the index.
. xref:create-custom-analyzer.adoc[] with the following settings:
.. In the *Name* field, enter `keyword_to_lower`.
.. In the *Tokenizer* list, select *single*. 
.. In the *Token Filters* list, select and add the *to_lower* token filter. 
. Expand *Custom Filters*. 
. xref:create-custom-token-filter.adoc#edge-ngram[Create a custom token filter] with the following settings: 
.. In the *Name* field, enter `edge_ngram_2_8`.
.. In the *Type* list, select *edge_ngram*. 
.. In the *Min* field, enter `2`, or the minimum number of characters you want the Search index to use for autocomplete.
.. In the *Max* field, enter `8`, or the maximum number of characters you want the Search index to use for autocomplete.
. xref:create-custom-analyzer.adoc[Create another custom analyzer] with the following settings:
.. In the *Name* field, enter `edge_ngram`.
.. In the *Tokenizer* list, select *unicode*.  
.. In the *Token Filters* list, select and add the *to_lower* and your custom *edge_ngram_2_8* token filter.
. Under *Mappings*, clear the *default* type mapping. 
. xref:create-type-mapping.adoc[] with the following settings: 
.. Clear *index all contained fields*.
. (Optional) If the field you want to search with autocomplete is nested inside a JSON object in your documents, xref:create-child-mapping.adoc[] for the JSON object with the following settings: 
.. Clear *index all contained fields*.
. Under the type mapping or child mapping, xref:create-child-field.adoc[] with the following settings:
.. In the *field* field, enter the name of a text field in a document from your selected scope and collection. 
.. In the *analyzer* list, select your *edge_ngram* analyzer. 
.. Select *index*.
.. Select *store*. 
.. Select *include in _all field*. 
. Expand *Advanced*. 
. In the *Default Analyzer* list, select your *keyword_to_lower* analyzer. 
. Click btn:[Create Index]

TIP: You can use the generated index definition JSON payload from the UI to create a Search index with the REST API.

[#api]
=== Create an Autocomplete Search Index with the REST API 

To create an autocomplete Search index from the REST API: 

. xref:create-search-index-rest-api.adoc[] with the following JSON payload, replacing all placeholder values that start with a `$`:
+
[source,json]
----
include::example$autocomplete-search-index.jsonc[]
----

== Next Steps

To add an autocomplete feature to your application, see xref:search-query-auto-complete-code.adoc[] for example code.
