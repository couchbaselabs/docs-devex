:description: You can create a Search index with the Search Service API. 

[abstract]
{description}

You must create a Search index before you can xref:simple-search-rest-api.adoc[run a search] with the Search Service.

== Prerequisites 

* You have the Search Service enabled on a node in your database.
For more information about how to deploy a new node and Services on your database, see xref:server:manage:manage-nodes/node-management-overview.adoc[].

* You have a bucket with scopes and collections in your database.
For more information about how to create a bucket, see xref:server:manage:manage-buckets/create-bucket.adoc[]. 

* Your user account has the *Search Admin* role for the bucket where you want to create the index. 

* You have installed the Couchbase command-line tool (CLI).

* You have the hostname or IP address for the node in your database where you're running the Search Service.
For more information about where to find the IP address for your node, see xref:server:manage:manage-nodes/list-cluster-nodes.adoc[].

== Procedure 

To create a Search index with the REST API: 

. In your command-line tool, enter a `curl` command with the `XPUT` verb. 
. Set your header content to include `"Content-Type: application/json"`.
. Enter your username, password, and the Search Service endpoint on port `8094` with the name of the index you want to create: 
+
[source,console]
----
include::example$create-search-index-header.sh[]
----
+
To use SSL, use the `https` protocol in the Search Service endpoint URL and port `18094`.
+
[NOTE]
====
Your index name must start with an alphabetic character (a-z or A-Z). It can only contain alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, or 0-9), hyphens (-), or underscores (_).

For Couchbase Server version 7.6 and later, your index name must be unique inside your selected bucket and scope.
You cannot have 2 indexes with the same name inside the same bucket and scope.
====

. Enter the JSON payload for the settings you want in your index. 
+
Do not include the xref:search-index-params.adoc#uuid[uuid] or xref:search-index-params.adoc#sourceuuid[sourceUUID] parameters. 
+
TIP: If you remove the xref:search-index-params.adoc#uuid[uuid] and xref:search-index-params.adoc#sourceuuid[sourceUUID] parameters, you can copy the Search index definition JSON payload from the Couchbase {page-ui-name} to use in your REST API call.
For more information about how to create an index with the UI, see xref:create-search-index-ui.adoc[]. 

=== Example

In the following example, the JSON payload creates a simple index named `landmark-content-index` on the `travel-sample` bucket. It creates a type mapping for the `inventory.landmark` collection, with a child field, `content`:

[source,console]

include::example$create-search-index-payload.sh[]

For more information about the available JSON properties for a Search index, see xref:search-index-params.adoc[].

== Next Steps

After you create a Search index, you can xref:simple-search-rest-api.adoc[] to test your Search index. 

If you want to edit your index with another REST API call, include the xref:search-index-params.adoc#uuid[uuid] parameter with the UUID the Search Service assigned to your Search index.

You can also xref:simple-search-ui.adoc[] or with one of the Couchbase SDKs:
