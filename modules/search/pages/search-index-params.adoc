[abstract]
{description}

You can choose to create a Search index with a JSON payload, and xref:import-search-index.adoc[import it through the Capella UI].
This JSON payload sets all the settings for your new Search index.

Your JSON payload must contain the properties described in <<initial,>>, including the <<params,>>.

xref:index-aliases.adoc[Search index aliases] only need to include the properties described in <<initial,>>.

[#initial]
== Initial Settings 

The start of the JSON payload for a Search index contains important settings for your index: 

[source,json]
----
include::example$simple-search-index-payload.jsonc[tag=json-snippet]
----

// include::example$simple-search-index-payload.jsonc[lines=1..14]

TIP: To view the entire JSON payload, click btn:[View].

All Search index payloads have the following properties: 

[cols="1,1,1,2"]
|====
|Property |Type |Required? |Description

|name |String |Yes |The name of the Search index. A Search index name must be unique for each cluster.

|type |String |Yes a|

The type of index you want to create: 

* `fulltext-index`: Create a Search index.
* `fulltext-alias`: Create an alias for a Search index. 
For more information about Search index aliases, see xref:index-aliases.adoc[].

|[[uuid]]uuid |String |No a|

The UUID for the Search index. 

The Search Service automatically generates a UUID for a Search index. 

If you use an existing UUID, the Search Service updates the existing Search index. 
Do not include the `uuid` property when you want to copy an index to a different cluster or create a new index.

View the UUID for an existing index from the {page-ui-name} by selecting an existing index and clicking btn:[Index Definition].
The UUID displays in the Index Definition on the Update Index page.

|sourceType |String |Yes |The `sourceType` is always `"gocbcore"` for a Search index.
For a xref:index-aliases.adoc[Search index alias], it's `"nil"`.

|sourceName |String |Yes |The name of the bucket where you want to create the Search index.
Do not include a `sourceName` for a Search index alias. 

|[[sourceuuid]]sourceUUID |String |No a|

The UUID of the bucket where you want to create the Search index.  

The Search Service automatically finds the UUID for the bucket.

Do not include the `sourceUUID` property when you want to copy an index to a different cluster, or create a new index.

|sourceParams |Object |No a|

This object contains advanced settings for index behavior.

Do not add content into this object unless instructed by Couchbase Support.

|planParams |Object |Yes a|An object that sets the Search index's partitions and replications. 
For more information, see <<planparams,>>.

Do not include any of the properties in a `planParams` object for a xref:index-aliases.adoc[Search index alias].

|params |Object |Yes a|

An object that sets the Search index's type identifier, type mappings, and analyzers.

----

TIP: To view the entire JSON payload, click btn:[View].

The `planParams` object contains the following properties: 

[cols="2,1,1,4"]
|====
|Property |Type |Required? |Description

|maxPartitionsPerPIndex |n/a |No |This setting is deprecated. Use `indexPartitions`, instead.
|indexPartitions |Number |Yes a|The number of partitions to split the Search index into, across the nodes you have available in your database with the Search Service enabled.
Use index partitions to increase index and query performance on large datasets.

NOTE: The scoring calculation for regular Search queries can be affected by the number of partitions in your Search index, and how the Search Service distributes documents across partitions.
This is a limitation of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf[tf-idf^] weighting scheme.

|numReplicas |Number |Yes a|

For high-availability, set the number of replicas the Search Service creates for the Search index. 

You can create up to three replicas for a Search index. 
Each replica creates a full copy of the Search index to increase high-availability.
To turn off replication for the Search index, set `numReplicas` to `0`.

The number of replicas you can create depends on the number of nodes you have available with the Search Service enabled.
|====
[#params]

The `default_mapping` object is a child object of the <<mapping,>>. 
It contains the following properties: 

[cols="1,1,1,2"]
|====
|Property |Type |Required? |Description

|dynamic |Boolean |Yes a|
To index all available fields in a document with the default type mapping, set `dynamic` to `true`. 

To only index the fields you specify in the type mapping, set `dynamic` to `false`.

|enabled |Boolean |Yes a|
To enable the Search Service's default type mapping, set `enabled` to `true`. 

The default type mapping includes all documents in the bucket in the Search index, even if they do not match another configured type mapping.
This can increase index size and indexing time. 

To disable the default type mapping, set `enabled` to `false`.

[#types]
== Types Object

The `types` object contains any additional user-defined type mappings for a Search index. 

[source,json]
----
include::example$simple-search-index-payload.jsonc[tag=types]

TIP: To view the entire JSON payload, click btn:[View].

The `types` object is a child object of the <<mapping,>>. 
It contains any number of <<scope-collection,{scope}.{collection} objects>>: 

[cols="1,1,1,2"]
|====
|Property |Type |Required? |Description

|\{scope\}.\{collection\} |Object |Yes a|

The name of the type mapping. 
Corresponds to the selected scope and collection where the type mapping applies. 
For example, `inventory.airline`. 

For more information about the properties in an `\{scope\}.\{collection\}` object, see <<scope-collection,>>. 

TIP: To add a type identifier as an additional filter to your type mapping, add the filter to the end of your `\{scope\}.\{collection\}` object. For example, to use a `type_field` filter that uses the `type` field, and add only documents with a `type` value of `hotel`, the object name would be `\{scope\}.\{collection\}.hotel`

[#scope-collection]
=== \{Scope\}.\{collection\} Objects, JSON Object Field Objects, and XATTRs Objects

The `\{scope\}.\{collection\}` object defines a custom type mapping for a Search index, on a specific scope and collection in the database:

[source,json]
----
include::example$simple-search-index-payload.jsonc[tag=scope_collection]
----

A `\{scope\}.\{collection\}` object is a child object of the <<types,>>.

A JSON object field object is a child object of the `\{scope\}.\{collection\}` object. 
It defines a mapping for a field that contains a JSON object in your document schema. 
It can contain additional mappings as <<child-fields,>> under its <<properties,properties>> object. 

A JSON object field object must: 

* Be a child object of a `\{scope\}.\{collection\}` object.
* Have a name that matches a JSON object child field in your documents.
* Use the same property structure as a `\{scope\}.\{collection\}` object.

If your database is running Couchbase Server version 7.6.2 and later and you're adding Extended Attributes (XATTRs) from your document metadata to your Search index, your XATTRs mapping definition must: 

* Be a child object of a `\{scope\}.\{collection\}` object.
* Have the name `_$xattrs`.
* Use the same property structure as a `\{scope\}.\{collection\}` object.

For example, the following JSON index definition snippet defines a `\{scope\}.\{collection\}` object for the `inventory.hotel` scope and collection. 
It adds a dynamic mapping for any XATTRs metadata present on documents in the collection.
It adds two nested JSON Object Field objects, `reviews` and `ratings`, that contain a single <<child-fields,child field object>> for the `Cleanliness` field:

[source,json]

You can view the JSON document schema for this example by looking at any document in the `hotel` collection from the `travel-sample` dataset.
For more information, see xref:manage:manage-documents/manage-documents.adoc[].

`\{scope\}.\{collection\}` objects, JSON Object Field objects, and XATTRs objects can contain the following properties:

[cols="1,1,1,2"]
|====
|Property |Type |Required? |Description

|dynamic |Boolean |Yes a|

To index all fields under the specified scope and collection, JSON object, or all fields inside XATTRs, set `dynamic` to `true`.

To only index the fields you specify and enable the `properties` block, set `dynamic` to `false`. 

|enabled |Boolean |Yes a| 

To enable the mapping and include any documents that match it in the Search index, set `enabled` to `true`. 

To remove any documents that match this mapping from the Search index, set `enabled` to `false`.

|[[properties]]properties |Object |No a|

The `properties` object is only enabled if `dynamic` is set to `false`. 

Specifies properties for the fields to index in the mapping. 
Contains any number of `\{field_name\}` objects. 

For more information, see <<child-fields,>>.

|====

[#child-fields]
=== \{field_name\} Object

The `\{field_name\}` object contains properties and an array for a child field in a type mapping.
You can have multiple `\{field_name\}` objects in a <<properties,properties object>>.

[source,json]
----
include::example$simple-search-index-payload.jsonc[tag=field_name]
----

TIP: To view the entire JSON payload, click btn:[View].

The name of the object corresponds to the name of the field you want to include or exclude from your Search index. 

A `\{field_name\}` object contains the following properties:

[cols="1,1,1,2"]
|====
|Property |Type |Required? |Description

|enabled |Boolean |Yes a|

To add this child field to the Search index, set `enabled` to `true`.

To remove this child field from the index, set `enabled` to `false`.

|dynamic |Boolean |No a|This field is included for legacy compatibility only. 

|fields |Array |Yes a|

An array that contains objects with settings for each child field to index in the type mapping.

For more information, see <<fields,>>. 

|====

[#fields]
=== Fields Array 

The `fields` array contains objects with settings for each child field to index in the type mapping:

[source,json]

TIP: To view the entire JSON payload, click btn:[View].

The `fields` array is located inside a <<child-fields,{field_name} object>>.
It contains the following properties: 

[cols="1,1,1,2"]
|====
|Property |Type |Required? |Description

|analyzer |String |Text Only a|

If the child field's `type` is `text`, set the analyzer to use for the child field. 

NOTE: If you want to use the default analyzer for the content of this child field, you don't need to include an `analyzer` property.  

|[[dims]]dims |Number |Vector Only a|

include::partial$vector-search-field-descriptions.adoc[tag=dimension]

|docvalues |Boolean |Yes a|

To include the value for each instance of the field in the Search index to support xref:search-request-params.adoc#facet-name[facets] and sorting search results, set `docvalues` to `true`.

To exclude the values for each instance of this field from the index, set `docvalues` to `false`.

|[[include-in-all]]include_in_all |Boolean |Yes a|

To allow this field to be searched without specifying the specific field's name in the search, set `include_in_all` to `true`.

When enabled, you can search this field through the specified `default_field` set in the type mapping.

To only search this field by specifying the field name, set `include_in_all` to `false`.

|[[term-vectors]]include_term_vectors |Boolean |Yes a|

NOTE: To use term vectors, `store` must be set to `true`.

To allow the Search Service to highlight matching search terms in search results for this field, set `include_term_vectors` to `true`.

You must also enable term vectors to use `includeLocations` in a Search query. For more information, see xref:search-request-params.adoc#includelocations[includeLocations].

To disable term highlighting and reduce index size, set `include_term_vectors` to `false`.

|index |Boolean |Yes a|

To include the child field in the Search index, set `index` to `true`.

To exclude the child field from the index, set `index` to `false`.

|name |String |Yes |The child field's name.

|[[similarity]]similarity |String |Vector Only a|

include::partial$vector-search-field-descriptions.adoc[tag=similarity_metric]

|store |Boolean |Yes a|

To include the content of the child field in the Search index and allow its content to be viewed in search results, set `store` to `true`.

To exclude the content of the child field from the index, set `store` to `false`.

|type |String |Yes a|

The child field's type. Can be one of:

* `text`
* `number`
* `datetime`
* `boolean`
* `geopoint`
* `geoshape`
* `disabled`
* `ip`
* `vector`
