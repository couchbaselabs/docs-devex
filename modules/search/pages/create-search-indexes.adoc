:description: Create a Search index to get started with the Search Service in your database. 

[abstract]
{description}

You can create a Search index with: 

* The <<ui,Couchbase {page-ui-name}>>. 
// * The <<sdks,Couchbase SDKs>>.
* A JSON payload that you xref:import-search-index.adoc[import through the UI].

All Search indexes are built from a JSON payload. 
For more information about the available properties for a Search index JSON payload, see xref:search-index-params.adoc[].

TIP: If you're new to developing with the Search Service, <<ui,create a Search index with the UI>>. 
You can export the Search index definition JSON payload from the UI to xref:import-search-index.adoc[].

[#ui]
== Creating a Search Index with the {page-ui-name}

Couchbase {page-product-name} supports two editing modes for the Search Service: 

* <<quick-mode,Quick Mode>>
* <<advanced-mode,Advanced Mode>>

[#quick-mode]
=== Quick Mode Editing

Quick Mode editing is on by default when you xref:create-search-index-ui.adoc[create a new Search index].
It supports: 

* xref:create-search-index-ui.adoc#configure-settings[Configuring global index settings], which include:
** xref:customize-index.adoc#analyzers[Setting a default analyzer]
** xref:customize-index.adoc#date-time[Setting a default date/time parser]
* Creating xref:customize-index.adoc#type-mappings[Type mappings and mappings]
* Configuring xref:customize-index.adoc#replica[Replica and partition settings]

[#advanced-mode]
=== Advanced Mode Editing 

If you select *Enable Advanced Options* to enable Advanced Mode in the Search index editor, the following additional options become available: 

* Creating custom xref:customize-index.adoc#analyzers[analyzers], which can include: 
** Custom xref:customize-index.adoc#character-filters[character filters]
** Custom xref:customize-index.adoc#tokenizers[tokenizers]
** Custom xref:customize-index.adoc#token-filters[token filters], which can use custom xref:customize-index.adoc#wordlists[word lists]
* Creating custom xref:customize-index.adoc#date-time[date/time parsers]
* Creating xref:customize-index.adoc#type-mappings[mappings] for Extended Attributes (XATTRs) data in documents
* Creating xref:customize-index.adoc#type-mappings[mappings] for objects and fields that do not yet exist in your document schema
* Configuring a xref:customize-index.adoc#type-identifiers[document filter]

All Quick Mode options remain available in Advanced Mode editing. 

[NOTE]
====
For indexes created with Couchbase Server version 7.6 and later, index names must be unique inside a bucket and scope.
You cannot have 2 indexes with the same name inside the same bucket and scope on a {page-product-name} database running version 7.6.

The {page-ui-name} marks indexes as scoped or not scoped to a specific bucket and scope.

Indexes created with a previous version of Couchbase Server are not scoped. 
==== 

After you create a Search index, the Search Service streams data from your chosen collection or collections, and any document mutations, into the index builder.
Before your index finishes building, you can run a search and return partial results. 

//[#sdks]
//== Creating a Search Index with Couchbase SDKs

//You can create a Search index with Couchbase SDKs.

//For an example of directly using the Java SDK to create a Search index, see *NEED_NEW_EXAMPLE_PAGE*

//For more information about Search in the various Couchbase SDKs, see *SDK_INTRO_PAGE*.

// [#api]
// == Creating a Search Index with the REST API

// You can create a Search index with the REST API through a JSON payload.

// Most properties in the JSON payload correspond to settings in the {page-ui-name}. 
// You can also copy the Search index definition JSON payload from a Search index in the {page-ui-name} to use in a REST API call. 

// [NOTE]
// ====
// Use the scoped name for an index with the xref:server:rest-api:rest-fts.adoc[Search Service REST API] for any endpoints that do not include the bucket and scope in their path. 
// For example, you must use `bucket.scope.index_name` as the format for your index name with the `analyzeDoc` endpoint, but not with the new 7.6 `query` endpoint.
// ====

// For more information about how to use the REST API to create a Search index, see.
