[abstract]
{description}

== Prerequisites

* You've deployed the Search Service on a node in your database. 

* You have a bucket with scopes and collections in your database. 

* Your user account has the *Search Admin* role for the bucket where you want to create the index. 

* You've logged in to the Couchbase Server Web Console.

== Procedure

To run a geospatial Search query, <<geospatial-index,create a Search index with a geospatial type mapping>>. 

Then, <<geospatial-query,run a Search query from the Web Console>>.  

[#geospatial-index]
=== Create a Search Index with a Geospatial Type Mapping

To create the Search index from the Web Console: 

. Go to *Search*.
. Click btn:[Add Index].
. In the *Index Name* field, enter a name for the index. 
+
NOTE: Your index name must start with an alphabetic character (a-z or A-Z). It can only contain alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, or 0-9), hyphens (-), or underscores (_).

. In the *Bucket* list, select the bucket where you want to create the index.
. Expand *Customize Index*. 
. Select *Use non-default scope/collection(s)*.
.. In the *Scope* list, select the scope that contains the documents you want to include in your index. 
. xref:create-type-mapping.adoc[] on the collection in your database that you want to search. 
. xref:create-child-field.adoc[] on the new type mapping with the following settings: 
.. In the *Field* field, enter the name of the field in your documents that contains the geospatial data you want to search.
.. In the *Type* list, select *geopoint*. 
.. Select *Index*. 
.. Select *Include in _all field*. 
. Click btn:[OK].
. Click btn:[Create Index].

[#geospatial-query]
=== Run a Geospatial Search Query

To run a Search query against the Search index from the Web Console: 

. Go to *Search*.
. Click the index where you want to run a search.
. In the *Search this index* field, enter a search query. 
+
For example, the following query searches a geospatial field, `geo`, for any locations within a 100 mile radius of the coordinates `-2.235143, 53.482358`:

== Next Steps

You can xref:customize-index.adoc[customize your Search index] to improve search results and performance.

If you want to add autocomplete to your database's search, see xref:search-query-auto-complete.adoc[].
