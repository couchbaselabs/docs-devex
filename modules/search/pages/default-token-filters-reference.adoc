:description: Use a token filter to filter a tokenizer's results and get better search result matches. 

[abstract]
{description}

The Search Service's xref:customize-index.adoc#token-filters[token filters] work with xref:customize-index.adoc#tokenizers[tokenizers] to filter search input tokens. 
Tokens can come from the content of your Search index or a Search query.

For more information about token filters, see xref:customize-index.adoc#token-filters[Token Filters].

The following token filters are available: 

[cols="1,2"]
|====
|Token Filter Type |Description 

|apostrophe | Removes all characters after an apostrophe (') from tokenizer results. Also removes the apostrophe.
For example, the token `Couchbase's` becomes `Couchbase`.

|camelCase a| Splits text in camelCase inside tokenizer results into separate tokens. 

For example, the token filter splits the token `camelCaseText` into `camel`, `Case`, and `Text`.

|cjk_bigram | Converts Chinese, Japanese, and Korean tokenizer results into bigrams, or groups of two consecutive words. 

|cjk_width | Converts Chinese, Japanese, and Korean tokenizer results from full width ASCII variants into Latin characters, and half-width katakana characters into their equivalent kana characters. 

|elision_ca | Removes all characters before an apostrophe from Catalan language tokenizer results. Also removes the apostrophe.

|elision_fr a| 

Removes all characters before an apostrophe from French language tokenizer results. Also removes the apostrophe.

For example, the token filter converts the token `l'avion` to `avion`.

|elision_ga | Removes all characters before an apostrophe from Gaelic language tokenizer results. Also removes the apostrophe.

|elision_it | Removes all characters before an apostrophe from Italian language tokenizer results. Also removes the apostrophe.

|hr_suffix_transformation_filter | Replaces suffixes in Croatian tokenizer results with normalized suffixes. 

|lemmatizer_he | Lemmatizes similar forms of Hebrew words. Corrects spelling mistakes. 

|mark_he | Marks the Hebrew, non-Hebrew, and numeric tokens from tokenizer results. 

|niqqud_he | Forces niqqud-less spelling for Hebrew text in tokenizer results.

|normalize_ar | Uses http://unicode.org/reports/tr15/[Unicode Normalization^] to normalize Arabic characters in tokens. 

|normalize_ckb | Uses http://unicode.org/reports/tr15/[Unicode Normalization^] to normalize Kurdish characters in tokens.

|normalize_de | Uses http://unicode.org/reports/tr15/[Unicode Normalization^] to normalize German characters in tokens.

|normalize_fa | Uses http://unicode.org/reports/tr15/[Unicode Normalization^] to normalize Persian characters in tokens.

|normalize_hi | Uses http://unicode.org/reports/tr15/[Unicode Normalization^] to normalize Hindi characters in tokens.

|normalize_in | Uses http://unicode.org/reports/tr15/[Unicode Normalization^] to normalize Indonesian characters in tokens.

|possessive_en | Checks the second-last character in English-language tokenizer results for an apostrophe. If it finds an apostrophe, the token filter removes the last two characters from the token. 

|reverse | Reverses the tokens in tokenizer results. For example, the token filter converts the token `acrobat` to `taborca`.

|stemmer_ar | Checks Arabic tokenizer results for suffixes and prefixes. If it finds a suffix or any prefixes, the token filter removes them to leave the root word. 

|stemmer_ckb | Checks Kurdish tokenizer results for prefixes. If it finds a prefix, the token filter removes it to leave the root word. 

|stemmer_da_snowball | Uses the https://snowballstem.org/[Snowball string processing language^] to convert Danish language tokenizer results into word stems. 

|stemmer_de_light a| 

Uses light stemming to convert German language tokenizer results into word stems. 

Regular stemming can affect the semantic meaning of words, as several words with different meanings might have the same root stem. 

Light stemming only removes frequently used prefixes and suffixes, and doesn't produce the root of a word to preserve semantics. 

|stemmer_de_snowball | Uses the https://snowballstem.org/[Snowball string processing language^] to convert German language tokenizer results into word stems. 

|stemmer_en_snowball | Uses the https://snowballstem.org/[Snowball string processing language^] to convert English language tokenizer results into word stems. 

|stemmer_es_light a|

Uses light stemming to convert Spanish language tokenizer results into word stems. 

Regular stemming can affect the semantic meaning of words, as several words with different meanings might have the same root stem. 

Light stemming only removes frequently used prefixes and suffixes, and doesn't produce the root of a word to preserve semantics. 

|stemmer_es_snowball | Uses the https://snowballstem.org/[Snowball string processing language^] to convert Castilian Spanish language tokenizer results into word stems. 

|stemmer_fi_snowball | Uses the https://snowballstem.org/[Snowball string processing language^] to convert Finnish language tokenizer results into word stems. 

|stemmer_fr_light a| 

Uses light stemming to convert French language tokenizer results into word stems. 

Regular stemming can affect the semantic meaning of words, as several words with different meanings might have the same root stem. 

Light stemming only removes frequently used prefixes and suffixes, and doesn't produce the root of a word to preserve semantics. 

|stemmer_fr_min a|

Uses minimal stemming to convert French language tokenizer results. 

Minimal stemming only removes the last character of a word or replaces some suffixes. For example, the `stemmer_fr_min` removes `x`, `s`, `r`, `e`, and `Ã©` characters from the end of words and replaces the `aux` suffix with `al`.

|stemmer_fr_snowball | Uses the https://snowballstem.org/[Snowball string processing language^] to convert French language tokenizer results into word stems. 

|stemmer_hi | Uses a https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-Lightweight-Stemmer-for-Hindi-Ramanathan-Rao/041a475a2b30b3f4397405e45098b40177e39de1[lightweight stemmer for Hindi^] to remove suffixes from tokenizer results.
