== Prerequisites 

* You have the Search Service enabled on a node in your database.
For more information about how to change Services on your database, see xref:cloud:clusters:modify-database.adoc[].

* You have a bucket with scopes and collections in your database. 
For more information, see xref:cloud:clusters:data-service/manage-buckets.adoc[].

* You have created an index with xref:create-search-index-ui.adoc[Advanced Mode].

* You have logged in to the Couchbase {page-ui-name}. 

== Procedure 

To set general settings for a Search index with the {page-ui-name}: 

. On the *Databases* page, select the database that has the Search index you want to edit. 
. Go to menu:Data Tools[Search].
. Click the index you want to edit.
. Under *Advanced Settings*, expand *General Settings*. 
. Configure any of the following general settings for your index:

|====
|Option |Description 

|Default Type |Change the default type assigned to documents in the index. 
The default value is `_default`.

|[[default-analyzer]]Default Analyzer a|

Change the default analyzer assigned to type mappings in the index. 

For more information about the available default analyzers, see xref:default-analyzers-reference.adoc[].

For more information about how to create your own custom analyzer, see xref:create-custom-analyzer.adoc[].

|[[date-time]]Default Date/Time Parser |Change the default date/time parser used for date data. 

|[[all-field]]Default Field a|

When you xref:create-child-field.adoc[create a mapping for a child field], you can choose to include that field in an `_all` field. 

You can add fields to the `_all` field to search their contents without specifying their field name in your search query. 

Enter a value in the *Default Field* field to change the name of this default field. 

|Store Dynamic Fields |Select *Store Dynamic Fields* to include field values in search results from a xref:customize-index.adoc#type-mappings[dynamic type mapping] in the index.

|Index Dynamic Fields |Select *Index Dynamic Fields* to include fields from a xref:customize-index.adoc#type-mappings[dynamic type mapping] in the index. 

|DocValues for Dynamic Fields |Select *DocValues for Dynamic Fields* to include the values of each field from a xref:customize-index.adoc#type-mappings[dynamic type mapping] in the index for xref:search-request-params.adoc#facets[Facets] and sorting search results.

|Number of Replicas a|

Set the number of replicas that the Search Service creates for the index. 

For more information about replication and the Search Service, see xref:server:fts:fts-high-availability-for-search.adoc[] in the Couchbase Server documentation.

|Number of Partitions |Enter a number greater than one to divide the index into partitions across multiple nodes running the Search Service.
