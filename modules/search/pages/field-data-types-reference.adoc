= Field Data Types 
:page-topic-type: reference 
:description: You can assign a data type to a field to tell the Search Service how to analyze its data. 

[abstract]
{description}

When you create a mapping for a field in xref:create-quick-index.adoc[Quick Mode] or xref:create-child-field.adoc[Advanced Mode], you need to set the field's data type. 

If you create a Search index and do not set a data type for a field, the Search Service automatically assigns a field data type.
For example, if you created a xref:customize-index.adoc#type-mappings[dynamic type mapping], the Search Service automatically assigns data types to all fields in the type mapping.

The following field data types are available: 

|====
|Field Data Type |Description 

|text |The field contains a string. The string can contain numbers and special characters.

|number |The field contains a number. It does not contain any alphabetic characters. 

|datetime |The field contains a date/time value that matches the format of a xref:customize-index.adoc#date-time[Date/Time Parser] in the index. 

|boolean |The field contains a true or false value. 

|disabled | This field data type is deprecated. It's included for compatibility only. 

|geopoint a|

The field contains geopoint (latitude and longitude) data, represented as either: 

* A string, as two numeric values separated by a comma. 
* A string, as a geohash point. 
* An array, as two floating point integers. 
* A JSON object, with the properties `lon`/`lng` and `lat`.

|geoshape a|

The field contains a GeoJSON object. 

A GeoJSON object describes a shape made of floating point coordinates with the following JSON properties: 

* A `type` string, for the type of GeoJSON object.
For example, a `point` or `MultiLineString`. 

* A `coordinates` array of floating point numbers, for each latitude and longitude coordinate point in the GeoJSON shape.

For example: 
----
{ 
    "type": "linestring",
    "coordinates": [ 

        [-2.753735609842721, 53.94860827535115],
        [-2.599898256093695,53.65007434185782] 
    ]
}
----
This JSON object describes a `LineString` GeoJSON object with 2 latitude and longitude coordinates.

For more information about GeoJSON queries, see xref:search-request-params.adoc#query-object[the Query object].

|ip a| 

The field contains an IP address, formatted in IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR syntax. 

For example: 
----
{
    "ipv4": "4.7.44.162",
    "ipv6": "2001:4800:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000"
}
----

|vector a|

The field contains an array of floating point numbers. 

Use the `vector` type to perform vector similarity searches with Vector Search. 

For more information about Vector Search, see xref:vector-search:vector-search.adoc[].
