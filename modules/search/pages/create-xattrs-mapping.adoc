:description: Use the {page-ui-name} to create a mapping for Extended Attributes (XATTRs) and search for them with the Search Service.

{description}

You must add an XATTRs mapping to your Search index to use and search for XATTRs metadata in your documents. 

== Prerequisites

* Your database is running Couchbase Server version 7.6.2 or later.

* You have the Search Service enabled on a node in your database.
For more information about how to change Services on your database, see xref:cloud:clusters:modify-database.adoc[].

* You have created an index.
For more information, see xref:create-search-index-ui.adoc[].

* You have created a type mapping for a collection. 
For more information about how to create a type mapping on an index, see xref:create-type-mapping.adoc[].

* You have logged in to the Couchbase {page-ui-name}. 


== Procedure

To add an XATTRs mapping to your Search index from the {page-ui-name}:

. On the *Databases* page, select the database that has the Search index you want to edit. 
. Go to menu:Data Tools[Search].
. Click the index where you want to create a child mapping.
. Under *Type Mappings*, next to an existing type mapping, go to menu:More Options (&vellip;)[Insert XATTRS Mapping].
. (Optional) To set a different analyzer for the XATTRs mapping, in the *Analyzer* list, select an analyzer.
+
You can select a xref:default-analyzers-reference.adoc[default analyzer] or xref:create-custom-analyzer.adoc[create your own].
. (Optional) To only index the fields you add to the XATTRs mapping, select *Index only specified fields*.
+
Otherwise, your XATTRs mapping is a xref:customize-index.adoc#type-mappings[dynamic mapping] that includes all child fields from your documents' metadata.  
. Click btn:[Submit]. 
. Click btn:[Update Index].

== Next Steps

After you create a XATTRs mapping, you can choose to add or remove fields in your document metadata from your Search index. 

XATTRs mappings, child mappings, and type mappings use child fields to add and remove fields from a Search index. 

For more information about how to add or remove fields from a mapping, see xref:create-child-field.adoc[].
