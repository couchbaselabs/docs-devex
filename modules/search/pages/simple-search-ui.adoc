For more information about how the Search Service scores documents in search results, see xref:run-searches.adoc#scoring[Scoring for Search Queries].

== Prerequisites 

* You have the Search Service enabled on a node in your database.
For more information about how to deploy a new node and Services on your database, see xref:server:manage:manage-nodes/node-management-overview.adoc[].

* You have a bucket with scopes and collections in your database.
For more information about how to create a bucket, see xref:server:manage:manage-buckets/create-bucket.adoc[]. 

* You have created a Search index. 
+
For more information about how to create a Search index, see xref:create-search-indexes.adoc[].

* Your user account has the *Search Admin* or *Search Reader* role. 

* You have logged in to the Couchbase {page-ui-name}. 

== Procedure 

To run a simple search with the Couchbase {page-ui-name}: 

. Go to *Search*.
. Click the index where you want to run a search.
. In the *Search this index* field, enter a search query. 
. Press kbd:[Enter] or click btn:[Search].
. (Optional) To view the full contents of a document returned in the search results, click one of the results. 
. (Optional) To view the results of document scoring in search results, click *Show Scoring*.
. (Couchbase Server version 7.6.2 and later) To directly edit the xref:search-request-params.adoc[Search request JSON payload] for your Search query and run a new search:
.. Click *show advanced query settings*. 
.. Click btn:[Edit]. 
.. Edit the JSON payload. 
For more information about the available parameters, see xref:search-request-params.adoc[].
.. Click btn:[Execute].

=== Example: Simple Text Search

For example, the following query searches for the strings `view`, `food`, and `beach`:

[source,json]
----
include::example$run-search-payload-ui.jsonc[]
----

The query payload enables scoring explanations and term highlighting. 
It also returns all available fields in the index, and returns 10 results per page.

TIP: Use a xref:index-aliases.adoc[Search index alias] to search multiple Search indexes in a single search query. 
Use the xref:search-request-params.adoc#collections[`collections` parameter] in your request to specify an array of collections to search from the Search index.

=== Example: Validate a Search Query

For example, the following query searches a Search index, `landmark-content-index`, using a xref:search-request-params.adoc#geopoint-queries-distance[Distance/Radius-Based Geopoint Query] on the `geo` field.
The query includes the xref:search-request-params.adoc#ctl[ctl object] with the `validate` property to validate the query:

[source,json]
----
include::example$run-search-validate-ui.jsonc[]
----

Since the `landmark-content-index` does not include a mapping for the `geo` field and the `validate` property is included in the query, the Web Console returns the following error: 

----
query_validate: field not indexed, name: geo, type: geopoint
----

== Next Steps 

If you do not get the search results you were expecting, you can change the xref:search-request-params.adoc[JSON payload for your Search query].
If your database is running Couchbase Server version 7.6.2 and later, you can edit the JSON payload directly in the UI by clicking *show advanced query settings*. 

Run any changes to your JSON payload by clicking btn:[Execute].
