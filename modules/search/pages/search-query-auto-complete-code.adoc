After you xref:search-query-auto-complete-ui.adoc[create and configure a Search index that supports autocomplete], configure your application to return results from the Search Service.

== Prerequisites 

* You have the Search Service enabled on a node in your database.
For more information about how to change Services on your database, see xref:cloud:clusters:modify-database.adoc[].

* You have a bucket with scopes and collections in your database. 
For more information, see xref:cloud:clusters:data-service/manage-buckets.adoc[].

* You have the hostname for the node in your database that's running the Search Service.
+
For more information about how to find the hostname for a node in your {page-product-name} database, see xref:clouds:get-capella-host-name.adoc[].

* You have created a compatible Search index.
For more information, see xref:search-query-auto-complete-ui.adoc[].

* You have created database access credentials that have Read/Write permissions on the bucket and scope where you created your Search index. 
For more information, see xref:clusters:manage-database-users.adoc[].

== Procedure 

To add autocomplete with the Search Service to your application:

. Test that your Search index was configured correctly by xref:simple-search-ui.adoc[running a Search query from the {page-ui-name}] with 2-8 characters in the *Search* field. 
+
For example, with the `travel-sample` bucket, you could enter the strings `Be`, `Bea`, `Beau`, and `Beauf` to find a document with the text `Beaufort Hotel`.

. Configure your application to return results from the Search Service.
+
The following examples simulate a user typing an input string and return search results for each partial string:
