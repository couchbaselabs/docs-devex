{description}

Use the xref:create-quick-index.adoc[Quick Editor] if you do not need full customization or advanced settings to quickly create a Search index and xref:customize-index.adoc#type-mappings[type mappings].

You must create a Search index before you can xref:simple-search-ui.adoc[run a search] with the Search Service.

You can also xref:import-search-index.adoc[].

== Prerequisites

* You have the Search Service enabled on a node in your database.
For more information about how to deploy a new node and Services on your database, see xref:server:manage:manage-nodes/node-management-overview.adoc[].

* You have a bucket with scopes and collections in your database.
For more information about how to create a bucket, see xref:server:manage:manage-buckets/create-bucket.adoc[]. 

* Your user account has the *Search Admin* role for the bucket where you want to create the index.  

* You have logged in to the Couchbase Server Web Console. 

== Procedure 

To create a Search index with the Couchbase Server Web Console: 

. Go to *Search*.
. Click btn:[Add Index].
. In the *Index Name* field, enter a name for the index. 
+
[NOTE]
====
Your index name must start with an alphabetic character (a-z or A-Z). It can only contain alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, or 0-9), hyphens (-), or underscores (_).

For Couchbase Server version 7.6 and later, your index name must be unique inside your selected bucket and scope. You cannot have 2 indexes with the same name inside the same bucket and scope.
====

. In the *Bucket* list, select the bucket where you want to create the index. 
. Expand *Customize Index*. 
. (Optional) To create the index on a scope other than `_default`, select *Use non-default scope/collection(s)*.
.. In the *Scope* list, select the scope where you want to create the index. 
. Click btn:[Create Index].

== Next Steps 

This basic index includes all documents from the bucket and scope you selected.
You can run a search against this index, but it's recommended that you customize your index to improve performance and reduce the index size.
