[abstract]
{description}

If you store date data in a format other than RFC-3339 (ISO-8601), then you need to create a date/time parser.

== Prerequisites 

* You have the Search Service enabled on a node in your database.
For more information about how to change Services on your database, see xref:cloud:clusters:modify-database.adoc[].

* You have logged in to the Couchbase {page-ui-name}. 

* You have started to create or already created an index in xref:create-search-index-ui.adoc[Advanced Mode].

== Procedure 

To create a custom date/time parser with the {page-ui-name} in Advanced Mode: 

. On the *Databases* page, select the database that has the Search index you want to edit. 
. Go to menu:Data Tools[Search].
. Click the index where you want to create a custom date/time parser.
. Under *Advanced Settings*, expand *Date Time Parsers*. 
+
NOTE: Make sure you use *Advanced Mode*.
. Click btn:[Add Date/Time Parser]
. In the *Name* field, enter a name for the date/time parser. 
. In the *New Word* field, enter a date/time layout with Go syntax. 
+
For more information, see the documentation about the https://pkg.go.dev/time#pkg-constants[Go Programming Language Time Package's Layout Constant^].
. Click btn:[Add]. 
. (Optional) To add an additional layout, repeat the previous steps. 
. Click btn:[Submit].

== Next Steps

After you create a custom date/time parser, you can xref:set-advanced-settings.adoc#date-time[set it as the default date/time parser] for your Search index.
