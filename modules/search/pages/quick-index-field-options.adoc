= Quick Index Mapping and Field Options 
:page-topic-type: reference

:description: When you create a Search index with Quick Mode in the {page-ui-name}, you must set options for each field or type mapping you add to the index. 

[abstract]
{description}

You can create the following types of type mappings in Quick Mode: 

* <<quick-collection,>>
* <<quick-field,>>

TIP: Indexing an entire collection in Quick Mode creates a dynamic type mapping for that collection. 
Indexing a field creates a static type mapping for the parent collection.
For more information about static and dynamic type mappings, see xref:customize-index.adoc#type-mappings[Search Index Features].

For more information about how to create a Search index with Quick Mode, see xref:create-quick-index.adoc[]. 

[#quick-collection]
== Quick Collection Type Mapping Options 

Configure an entire collection in Quick Mode to add or remove all documents in that collection from your Search index.

You can configure the following settings in Quick Mode for a type mapping that uses an entire collection: 

|====
|Option |Description 

| Index everything from collection: "`$COLLECTION_NAME`" a|

You must select *Index everything from collection* to add a collection type mapping in Quick Mode. 

| Index text fields as identifiers a|

To index any *Text* type fields with the xref:default-analyzers-reference.adoc#keyword[keyword analyzer], select *Index text fields as identifiers*.

For more information about analyzers, see xref:customize-index.adoc#analyzers[Search Index Features].

Select the language for the content inside any *Text* fields. 

The Search Service automatically applies an xref:customize-index.adoc#analyzers[analyzer] to the field's contents based on the selected language.
