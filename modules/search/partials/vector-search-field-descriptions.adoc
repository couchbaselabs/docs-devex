For a `vector` child field, choose whether the Search Service should prioritize recall or latency when returning similar vectors in search results:

* *recall*: The Search Service prioritizes returning the most accurate result.
This may increase resource usage for Search queries.
+
The Search Service uses an `nprobe` value to calculate the number of centroids to search when using recall priority.
This value is calculated by taking the square root of the number of centroids in the index.

* *latency*: The Search Service prioritizes returning results with lower latency. 
This may reduce the accuracy of results.
+
The Search Service uses half the `nprobe` value calculated for *recall* priority.

// tag::similarity_metric[]
For a `vector` child field, choose the method to calculate the similarity between the vector embedding in a Vector Search index and the vector embedding in a Vector Search query.

NOTE: It's recommended to choose the same similarity metric for your Search index as the one used in your embedding model.

* *dot_product*: Calculated by adding the result of multiplying a vector's components, or the product of the magnitudes of the vectors and the cosine of the angle between them.
The dot product of 2 vectors is affected by the length and direction of each of the vectors, rather than just taking a straight-line distance. 
+
Dot product similarity is commonly used by Large Language Models (LLMs).
Use *dot_product* to get the best results with an embedding model that uses dot product similarity. 

* *l2_norm*: Also known as Euclidean distance. 
Uses the straight-line distance between 2 vectors to calculate similarity. 
Smaller euclidean distances mean that the values of each coordinate in the vectors are closer together.
+
It's best to use *l2_norm* similarity when your embeddings contain information about the count or measure of specific things, and your embedding model uses the same similarity metric.

// tag::dimension[]
For a `vector` child field, enter the total number of elements in the vector embedding array.

From Couchbase Server version 7.6.2 and later, Vector Search indexes can support arrays with up to 4096 elements.
Arrays can be an array of arrays.
