== Prerequisites

Before continuing this tutorial, you must first:

* xref:install-couchbase-server.adoc[Run Couchbase Server]
* xref:buckets-scopes-and-collections.adoc[Implement the data model]
* Install the Java Software Development Kit (version 8, 11, 17, or 21)
* Install Apache Maven (version 3+)

[TIP]
====
The easiest way to install and manage Java SDKs and Maven on your machine is through https://sdkman.io/install[SDKMan^].

After following the instructions to install SDKMan, open a terminal window and run the commands `sdk install java` and `sdk install maven` to install the latest versions of Java and Maven. 
====

For more information about the Java SDK installation, see the xref:java-sdk:project-docs:sdk-full-installation.adoc[full installation page].

== Set Up the Java SDK

To set up the Java SDK:

. Create the following directory structure on your computer:
+
....
ðŸ“‚ ~ (your home directory)
  ðŸ“‚ student
    ðŸ“‚ src
      ðŸ“‚ main
        ðŸ“‚ java
....
+
. In the `student` directory, create a new file called `pom.xml`.
+
....
ðŸ“‚ ~ (your home directory)
  ðŸ“‚ student
  ðŸ“ƒ pom.xml â¬… here!
  ðŸ“‚ src
    ðŸ“‚ main
      ðŸ“‚ java
....
+
. Paste the following code block into your `pom.xml` file:
+
[source, xml]
----
include::example$pom.xml[]
----
+
. Open a terminal window and navigate to your `student` directory.
. Run the command `mvn install` to pull in all the dependencies and finish your SDK setup.

You can now connect your Java SDK to your cluster.

== Connect the SDK to Your Cluster

To connect to the cluster:

. In your `java` directory, create a new file called `ConnectStudent.java`.
+
....
ðŸ“‚ ~ (your home directory)
  ðŸ“‚ student
    ðŸ“ƒ pom.xml
    ðŸ“‚ src
      ðŸ“‚ main
        ðŸ“‚ java
          ðŸ“ƒ ConnectStudent.java â¬… here!
....
+
. Paste the following code block into your `ConnectStudent.java` file:
+
[source, java]
----
include::example$ConnectStudent.java[]
----
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You must re-run `mvn install` in your `student` directory whenever you make a change to a java file to rebuild your application. 
====
+
. Open a terminal window and navigate to your `student` directory.
. Run the command `mvn install` to pull in all the dependencies and rebuild your application.
. Run the following command to check that the connection works:
+
[source, sh]
----
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="ConnectStudent" -Dexec.cleanupDaemonThreads=false
----
+
If the connection is successful, the collection name outputs in the console log.
+

If you come across errors in your console, see the xref:java-tutorial/tutorial-troubleshooting.adoc[troubleshooting page].
