You can retrieve your records using the <<#retrieve-with-query-editor,query editor>> or the <<#retrieve-with-sdk,SDK>>.

[#retrieve-with-query-editor]
== With the Query Editor

To retrieve the records with the Query Editor, you must first define an index.

=== Define an Index

Before you can retrieve your records with the query editor, you must first define an index in your bucket.
The index helps your cluster find specific data when you run a query.

To define an index:

. In your Couchbase cluster in your browser, click menu:Query[] to open the query editor.
. Select *student-bucket* and *art-school-scope* in the *context* drop-down.
Using these filters means you can narrow down the scope of your queries. 
You do not need to add the names of your bucket and scope to your queries.
+

+
. Enter the following query into your query editor:
+
[source, sqlpp]
----
create primary index course_idx on `course-record-collection`
----
+
. Click btn:[Execute] to create a single index called `course_idx` in your `course-record-collection`.

=== Retrieve Your Records

You can use the Query Editor to retrieve all course records at once, or narrow your search down to retrieve records based on specific criteria.

==== Retrieve All Course Records

To retrieve all of your course records using the query editor:

. Enter the following query into your query editor:
+
[source, sqlpp]
----
select crc.* from `course-record-collection` crc
----
+
. Click btn:[Execute] to retrieve all course records.
+
[source, json]
----
[
  {
    "course-name": "art history",
    "credit-points": 100,
    "faculty": "fine art"
  },
  {
    "course-name": "fine art",
    "credit-points": 50,
    "faculty": "fine art"
  },
  {
    "course-name": "graphic design",
    "credit-points": 200,
    "faculty": "media and communication"
  }
]
----

==== Retrieve Course Records with Less than 200 Credits

You can expand your query to narrow your search down further.
To retrieve only courses with less than 200 `credit-points` using the query editor:

. Enter the following query into your query editor:
+
[source, sqlpp]
----
select crc.* from `course-record-collection` crc where crc.`credit-points` < 200
----
+
. Click btn:[Execute] to retrieve all courses with less than 200 credits.
+
[source, json]
----
[
  {
    "course-name": "art history",
    "credit-points": 100,
    "faculty": "fine art"
  },
  {
    "course-name": "fine art",
    "credit-points": 50,
    "faculty": "fine art"
  }
]
----

=== Retrieve Record IDs

The `id` field is not automatically returned when you retrieve all of your course information.

The `id` is part of a document's meta structure, and to retrieve it you must adjust your {sqlpp} query and run it again:

. Enter the following query into your query editor:
+
[source, sqlpp]
----
select META().id, crc.* from `course-record-collection` crc where crc.`credit-points` < 200
----
+
The `META()` function call returns any property contained inside the document's metadata, including the ID.
+
. Click btn:[Execute] to retrieve course records and their IDs.
+
[source, json]
----
[
  {
    "course-name": "art history",
    "credit-points": 100,
    "faculty": "fine art",
    "id": "ART-HISTORY-000001"
  },
  {
    "course-name": "fine art",
    "credit-points": 50,
    "faculty": "fine art",
    "id": "FINE-ART-000002"
  }
]
----


[#retrieve-with-sdk]
== With the SDK

You can also use {sqlpp} queries to retrieve your records with the SDK.
Unlike the query editor, though, you must include the name of the bucket and the scope to fully qualify the name of the collection in the {sqlpp} statement in your application. 
For example:

[source, sqlpp]
----
select crc.* from `student-bucket`.`art-school-scope`.`course-record-collection` crc
----

=== Retrieve Your Records

You can use the SDK to retrieve all course records at once, or narrow your search down to retrieve records based on specific criteria.

==== Retrieve All Course Records

To retrieve all of your course records using the Java SDK:

. In your `java` directory, create a new file called `ArtSchoolRetriever.java`.
. Paste the following code block into your `ArtSchoolRetriever.java` file:
+
[source, java]
----
include::example$ArtSchoolRetrieverAll.java[]
----
+
. Open a terminal window and navigate to your `student` directory.
. Run the command `mvn install` to pull in all the dependencies and rebuild your application.
. Run the following command to retrieve all course records:
+
[source, sh]
----
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="ArtSchoolRetriever" -Dexec.cleanupDaemonThreads=false
----
+
If the retrieval is successful, the course information outputs in the console log.
+

==== Retrieve Course Records with Less than 200 Credits

You can set parameters in your code to narrow your search down further.
To retrieve only courses with less than 200 `credit-points` using the Java SDK:

. In your `java` directory, create a new file called `ArtSchoolRetrieverParameters.java`.
. Paste the following code block into your `ArtSchoolRetrieverParameters.java` file:
+
[source, java]
----
include::example$ArtSchoolRetriever.java[]
----
+
. Open a terminal window and navigate to your `student` directory.
. Run the command `mvn install` to pull in all the dependencies and rebuild your application.
. Run the following command to retrieve all course records:
+
[source, sh]
----
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="ArtSchoolRetrieverParameters" -Dexec.cleanupDaemonThreads=false
----
+
If the retrieval is successful, the course information with your parameters outputs in the console log.

If you come across errors in your console, see the xref:java-tutorial/tutorial-troubleshooting.adoc[troubleshooting page].
