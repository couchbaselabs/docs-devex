== Add Enrollment Details

To add enrollment details to a student record:

. In your `java` directory, create a new file called `AddEnrollments.java`.
. Paste the following code block into your `AddEnrollments.java` file:
+
[source, java]
----
include::example$AddEnrollments.java[]
----
+
NOTE: Because this is a tutorial, you do not need to add an error check to make sure that your collection has returned an item.
In a live application, though, error checks must be made to prevent errors and keep the application running.
+
. Open a terminal window and navigate to your `student` directory.
. Run the command `mvn install` to pull in all the dependencies and rebuild your application.
. Run the following command to insert the student record into the collection:
+
[source, sh]
----
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="AddEnrollments" -Dexec.cleanupDaemonThreads=false
----
+
. Go to your Couchbase cluster in your browser.
. Go to the `student-record-collection` and click the *Edit* icon or the document ID to see the new information you just added to Hilary's student record.
