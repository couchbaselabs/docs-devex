== Create a Student Record

After connecting to the cluster, you can create a student record in the form of a JSON document inserted into the `student-record-collection`.

To create a student record:

. In your `java` directory, create a new file called `InsertStudent.java`.
. Paste the following code block into your `InsertStudent.java` file:
+
[source, java]
----
include::example$InsertStudent.java[]
----
+
. Open a terminal window and navigate to your `student` directory.
. Run the command `mvn install` to pull in all the dependencies and rebuild your application.
. Run the following command to insert the student record into the collection:
+
[source, sh]
----
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="InsertStudent" -Dexec.cleanupDaemonThreads=false
----
+
. Go to your Couchbase cluster in your browser and check the `student-record-collection` for the new student record you just added:
.. Go to menu:Documents[Workbench].
.. Under *Keyspace*, select `student-bucket`, `art-school-scope`, and `student-record-collection`.

== Create Course Records

Creating course records is similar to creating student records.
To create course records:

. In your `java` directory, create a new file called `InsertCourses.java`.
. Paste the following code block into your `InsertCourses.java` file:
+
[source, java]
----
include::example$InsertCourses.java[]
----
+
. Open a terminal window and navigate to your `student` directory.
. Run the command `mvn install` to pull in all the dependencies and rebuild your application.
. Run the following command to insert the student record into the collection:
+
[source, sh]
----
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="InsertCourses" -Dexec.cleanupDaemonThreads=false
----
+
. Go to your Couchbase cluster in your browser and check the `course-record-collection` for the new course records you just added.
