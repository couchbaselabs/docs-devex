= Archive Documents After Expiration
:description: When a document in an existing collection is about to expire, use the Eventing Service to create an archived copy of that document in a different collection.

{description}

This example is similar to the xref:eventing-examples-docexpiry.adoc[Create a New Document When a Document Expires] example, but has the following differences:

* It archives a perfect copy in the target collection
* It does not log errors unless a document is missing when the callback function to archive the document is triggered
* Does not rely on a Couchbase SDK - instead, it relies on the expiry set on the source collection, where all documents have an expiration of 10 minutes from the time of their first mutation

The `OnUpdate` JavaScript handler runs whenever a document is created or mutated.
The Eventing Function calls a Timer, which executes a callback function 2 minutes before a document expires and archives an identical document with the same key in a specified target bucket.

The original document in the source bucket does not change, but is deleted following the bucket's expiration date.


== Prerequisites

Before trying out the examples on this page, you must first:

* Import the `tavel-sample` sample bucket.
* Create two new buckets called `bulk` and `rr100` with a minimum size of 100MB.
* Inside the `bulk` bucket, create two keyspaces called `bulk.data.source` and `bulk.data.target`.
* Update the `source` collection's TTL (Time-to-Live) to *600*. 
* Inside the `rr100` bucket, create one keyspace called `rr100.eventing.metadata`.

For more information about creating buckets, scopes, and collections, see xref:data-service:manage-buckets.adoc[].

NOTE: Do not add, modify, or delete documents in the Eventing storage keyspace `rr100.eventing.metadata` while your Eventing Functions are in a deployed state.

=== Create an Eventing Function

To create a new Eventing Function:

. Go to menu:Data Tools[Eventing].
. Click btn:[Add Function].
. In the *Settings* page, enter the following Function settings:
** *archive_before_expiry* under *Name*.
** *Archive all documents in a collection before a document expires.* under *Description*.
** The keyspace `bulk.data.source` under *Listen to Location*.
** The keyspace `rr100.eventing.metadata` under *Eventing Storage*. 
. Click btn:[Next].
. In the *Bindings* page, click btn:[Add Binding] and create two bindings.
** For the first binding:
*** Select *Bucket*.
*** Enter *src* as the *Alias Name*.
*** Enter the keyspace `bulk.data.source` under *Bucket*, *Scope*, and *Collection*.
*** Select *Read Only* under *Permission*.
** For the second binding:
*** Select *Bucket*.
*** Enter *tgt* as the *Alias Name*.
*** Enter the keyspace `bulk.data.target` under *Bucket*, *Scope*, and *Collection*.
*** Select *Read and Write* under *Permission*.
. Click btn:[Next].
. In the code editor, replace the placeholder JavaScript code with the following code sample:
+
[source,javascript]
----
function OnUpdate(doc, meta) {
    // Only processes documents that have a non-zero TTL
    if (meta.expiration == 0 ) return;
    // Note: JavaScript Data() is in milliseconds and meta.expiration is in seconds
    if (new Date().getTime()/1000 > (meta.expiration - 120)) {
        // If within the 120 second limit for expiry, creates a copy now
        // Creates a new document with the same ID in the target collection
        // log('OnUpdate: copy src to tgt for DocId:', meta.id);        
        tgt[meta.id] = doc;
    } else {
        // Computes 120 seconds before the TTL (note that JavaScript Date() is in milliseconds)
        var twoMinsPrior = new Date((meta.expiration - 120) * 1000);
        // Creates a Timer with a context to run in the future, 120 seconds before the expiry
        // log('OnUpdate: create Timer '+meta.expiration+' - 120, for  DocId:',  meta.id);
        createTimer(DocTimerCallback, twoMinsPrior , meta.id, meta.id);
    }
}
function DocTimerCallback(context) {
    // This context is the key to the document that expires in 120 seconds
    var doc = src[context]; 
    if (doc) {
        // Creates a new document with the same ID in the target collection
        // log('DocTimerCallback: copy src to tgt for DocId:', context);
        tgt[context] = doc;
    } else {
        log('DocTimerCallback: issue missing value for DocId:', context);
    }
}
----
+
. Click btn:[Create function] to create your Eventing Function.

The `OnUpdate` handler creates a Timer that fires 2 minutes before the document's expiration time.

=== Deploy the Eventing Function

Deploy your Eventing Function:

. Go to menu:Data Tools[Eventing].
. Click *More Options (â‹®)* next to *archive_before_expiry*.
. Click *Deploy* to deploy your Function.

After it's deployed, the Eventing Function executes on all existing documents and any documents you create in the future.

=== Insert Documents into Source Bucket

To insert documents into your *source* bucket:

. Go to menu:Data Tools[Query].
. For the *Query Context*, select *travel-sample* as the bucket and *_default* as the scope.
. In the code editor, enter the following query to locate a large set of data in the sample bucket:
+
[source,sqlpp]
----
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `travel-sample`.`_default`.`_default` where type = 'airport'
----
+
. Click btn:[Run] to run the query.
. In the code editor, replace the previous query with the following query to insert documents from the *_default* collection of the *travel-sample* bucket into the *source* collection you created earlier:
+
[source,sqlpp]
----
INSERT INTO `bulk`.`data`.`source`(KEY _k, VALUE _v)
    SELECT META().id _k, _v FROM `travel-sample`.`_default`.`_default` _v WHERE type="airport";
----
+
. Click btn:[Run] to run the query.
. Go to menu:Data Tools[Eventing].
. Click the *archive_before_expiry* function. The number under *Successes* should be 1968, which is the same number of documents inserted into the *source* collection from the *_default* collection of the *travel-sample* bucket.

=== Check Document Archival

To check that your Eventing Function is running properly and archiving documents:

. Go to menu:Data Tools[Documents].
. Expand the *rr100* bucket and the *eventing* scope. The *metadata* collection should have 1280 documents in it that are related to your Eventing Function, and 4192 documents that are related to active Timers.
. Expand the *bulk* bucket and the *data* scope. The *source* collection should have 1968 documents in it, inserted through the {sqlpp} query earlier.
. Wait a few minutes and check the *Documents* tab again.
The Timer has fired and executed the `DocTimerCallback` function, which archives the documents from the *source* collection into the *target* collection.
You should see the following:
* 1968 documents in the *source* collection.
* 1968 documents in the *target* collection.
. Go to menu:Data Tools[Eventing].
. Click the *archive_before_expiry* function. The number under *Successes* should have doubled to 3936.

If you wait a few more minutes until the 120 second expiry window is reached, the documents inside the *source* collection are no longer accessible because of the collection's pre-defined TTL.
The 1968 archived documents are still in the *target* collection, but the original documents in the *source* collection have expired.
