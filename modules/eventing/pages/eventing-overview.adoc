== Eventing Service

The Eventing Service executes user-defined business logic and responds in real time whenever applications interact and cause your data to change. 
This change in data is known as a document mutation, and includes operations such as insert, delete, update, and expiration.

You can use the Eventing Service to:

* Monitor specific parameters in a document
* Set alerts in a document when a preconfigured threshold is breached
* Propagate data changes inside a database
* Enrich documents in real time
* Cascade deletes to avoid orphaned documents


== Eventing Functions

The Eventing Service can run one or more Eventing Functions in your database to handle data changes according to a real-time Event-Condition-Action model. 
Eventing Functions are standalone JavaScript fragments that trigger in real time as a response to document mutations.

Eventing Functions allow you to:

* Integrate with the Data Service to:
** Read, write, and delete documents
** Work with Atomic Counters, CAS, and TTLS
* Integrate with the Query Service to use inline {sqlpp} queries or statements
* Enable a Timer to schedule functions to run in the future
* Interact with external REST endpoints through cURL functionality

You can access Eventing Functions by going to menu:Data Tools[Eventing]. 
The Eventing Functions table includes the following:
