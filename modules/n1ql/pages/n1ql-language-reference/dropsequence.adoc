== Purpose

include::./sequenceops.adoc[tags=overview]

== Prerequisites

.RBAC Privileges
To execute the DROP SEQUENCE statement, you must have the _Query Manage Sequences_ privilege granted on the scope.
For more details about user roles, see {authorization-overview}[Authorization].

sequence:: (Required) A name that identifies the sequence within a namespace, bucket, and scope.

The sequence name specifies the name of the sequence to drop.

Each sequence is associated with a given namespace, bucket, and scope.
You must specify the namespace, bucket, and scope to refer to the sequence correctly.

[horizontal]
namespace::
(Optional) The {logical-hierarchy}[namespace] of the bucket which contains the sequence you want to drop.

bucket::
(Optional) The bucket which contains the sequence you want to drop.

scope::
(Optional) The scope which contains the sequence you want to drop.

identifier::
(Required) The name of the sequence.
The sequence name is case-sensitive.

Currently, only the `default` namespace is available.
If you omit the namespace, the default namespace in the current session is used.

If the {query-context}[query context] is set, you can omit the bucket and scope from the statement.
In this case, the bucket and scope for the sequence are taken from the query context.

The namespace, bucket, scope, and sequence name must follow the rules for {identifiers}[identifiers].
If the namespace, bucket, scope, or sequence name contain any special characters such as hyphens (-), you must wrap that part of the expression in backticks ({backtick} {backtick}).

=== IF EXISTS Clause

The optional `IF EXISTS` clause enables the statement to complete successfully when the specified sequence doesn't exist.

When the sequence does not exist within the specified context:

* If this clause is not present, an error is generated.

* If this clause is present, the statement does nothing and completes without error.

== Examples

[[ex-drop-seq1]]
.Drop a sequence in a specified scope
====
This statement drops a sequence in the specified scope.

[[ex-drop-seq2]]
.Drop a sequence in the current query context
====
This statement drops a sequence in the current query context, if a sequence of that name exists.

[source,sqlpp]
----
DROP SEQUENCE seq2 IF EXISTS;
