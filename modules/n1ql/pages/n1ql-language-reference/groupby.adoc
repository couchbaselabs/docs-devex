{description}

== Purpose

Use the GROUP BY clause to arrange aggregate values into groups of one or more fields.
This `GROUP BY` clause follows the `WHERE` clause and precedes the optional `GROUP AS`, `LETTING`, `HAVING`, and `ORDER BY` clauses.

[[group-term]]
=== Group Term

[source,ebnf]

image::n1ql-language-reference/group-term.png["Syntax diagram", align=left]

At least one group term is required.

[#group-term-args]
expr:: String or expression representing an xref:n1ql-language-reference/aggregatefun.adoc[aggregate function] or field to group together.

alias:: Assigns another name to the group term.
For details, see xref:n1ql-language-reference/from.adoc#section_ax5_2nx_1db[AS Clause].

Assigning an alias to the group term is optional.
If you assign an alias, the `AS` keyword may be omitted.

[[group-as]]
=== GROUP AS Clause

JSON is a hierarchical format, and a fully featured JSON query language needs to be able to produce hierarchies of its own, with computed data at every level of the hierarchy. 
The key feature of SQL{pp} that makes this possible is the `GROUP AS` clause.

A query can include a `GROUP AS` clause only if it has a `GROUP BY` clause. 
The effect of a `GROUP BY` clause is to hide the original objects in each group, exposing only the grouping expressions and special aggregation functions on the non-grouping fields. 
The purpose of the `GROUP AS` clause is to make the original objects in the group visible to subsequent clauses. 
As a result, the query can generate output data both for the group as a whole and for the individual objects inside the group.

For each group, the `GROUP AS` clause preserves all the objects in the group as they were before grouping, and gives a name to this preserved group. 
You can then use the group name in the `FROM` clause of a subquery to process and return the individual objects in the group.

[[letting-clause]]
=== LETTING Clause

[source,ebnf]
----
include::partial$grammar/dql.ebnf[tag=letting-clause]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/letting-clause.png["Syntax diagram", align=left]

[Optional] Stores the result of a sub-expression in order to use it in subsequent clauses.

[#letting-clause-args]
alias:: String or expression representing the name of the clause to be referred to.

expr:: String or expression representing the value of the `LETTING` [.var]`alias` variable.

[[having-clause]]
=== HAVING Clause

[source,ebnf]
----
include::partial$grammar/dql.ebnf[tag=having-clause]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/having-clause.png["Syntax diagram", align=left]

[Optional] To return items where xref:n1ql-language-reference/aggregatefun.adoc[aggregate] values meet the specified conditions.

[#having-clause-args]
cond:: String or expression representing the clause of aggregate values.

== Limitations

`GROUP BY` works only on a group key or xref:n1ql-language-reference/aggregatefun.adoc[aggregate function].

A query needs a predicate on a leading index key to ensure that the optimizer can select a secondary index for the query.
Without a matching predicate, the query will use the primary index.
The simplest predicate is `WHERE _leading-index-key_ IS NOT MISSING`.
This is usually only necessary in queries which do not otherwise have a WHERE clause; for example, some GROUP BY and aggregate queries.

NOTE: The `WHERE` clause is faster because `WHERE` gets processed _before_ any `GROUP BY` and doesn't have access to aggregated values.
`HAVING` gets processed _after_ `GROUP BY` and is used to constrain the resultset to only those with aggregated values.

.Using an alias for a group term

NOTE: The `CASE` expression categorizes each landmark into the Western hemisphere if its longitude is negative, or the Eastern hemisphere otherwise.
The alias in the `GROUP BY` clause enables you to refer to the `CASE` expression in the `SELECT` clause.
