{description}

== Purpose

Use the GROUP BY clause to arrange aggregate values into groups of one or more fields.
This `GROUP BY` clause follows the `WHERE` clause and can contain the optional `GROUP AS`, `LETTING`, and `HAVING` clauses.

At least one group term is required.

[#group-term-args]
expr:: String or expression representing an xref:n1ql-language-reference/aggregatefun.adoc[aggregate function] or field to group together.

alias:: Assigns another name to the group term.
For details, see xref:n1ql-language-reference/from.adoc#section_ax5_2nx_1db[AS Clause].

Assigning an alias to the group term is optional.
If you assign an alias, the `AS` keyword may be omitted.

[[group-as]]
=== GROUP AS Clause

JSON is a hierarchical format, and a fully featured JSON query language needs to be able to produce hierarchies of its own, with computed data at every level of the hierarchy. 
The key feature of SQL{pp} that makes this possible is the `GROUP AS` clause.

A query can include a `GROUP AS` clause only if it has a `GROUP BY` clause. 
The effect of a `GROUP BY` clause is to hide the original objects in each group, exposing only the grouping expressions and special aggregation functions on the non-grouping fields. 
The purpose of the `GROUP AS` clause is to make the original objects in the group visible to subsequent clauses. 
As a result, the query can generate output data both for the group as a whole and for the individual objects inside the group.

For each group, `GROUP AS` preserves all of the objects in the group, as they were before grouping, in an array. 
The name of the array is the alias in the GROUP AS clause. 
You can then use the array name in the `FROM` clause of a subquery to process and return the individual objects in the group.

In the `GROUP AS` array, each object is wrapped in an outer object that gives it the name of the alias specified in the `FROM` clause, or its implicit alias if no alias was specified.
Identifying the objects with their aliases in this way helps avoid ambiguity.

For example, a query has a `FROM` clause of `FROM airline as a, route as r`, and a `GROUP AS` clause of `GROUP AS g`. 
The `GROUP AS` clause preserves the airline and route objects together in the same array. 
These objects might contain field names that are the same, such as `"id"`. 
However, the resulting array `g` identifies each of the object separately with its alias, as follows:

[source,json]
----
[
	{
		"a": { an original airline object },
		"r": { an original route object }
	},
	{
		"a": { an original airline object },
		"r": { an original route object }
	},
	...
]

[[letting-clause]]
=== LETTING Clause

[source,ebnf]
----
include::partial$grammar/dql.ebnf[tag=letting-clause]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/letting-clause.png["Syntax diagram", align=left]

[Optional] Stores the result of a sub-expression in order to use it in subsequent clauses.

[#letting-clause-args]
alias:: String or expression representing the name of the clause to be referred to.

expr:: String or expression representing the value of the `LETTING` [.var]`alias` variable.

[[having-clause]]
=== HAVING Clause

[source,ebnf]
----
include::partial$grammar/dql.ebnf[tag=having-clause]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/having-clause.png["Syntax diagram", align=left]

[Optional] To return items where xref:n1ql-language-reference/aggregatefun.adoc[aggregate] values meet the specified conditions.

[#having-clause-args]
cond:: String or expression representing the clause of aggregate values.

== Limitations

`GROUP BY` works only on a group key or xref:n1ql-language-reference/aggregatefun.adoc[aggregate function].

A query needs a predicate on a leading index key to ensure that the optimizer can select a secondary index for the query.
Without a matching predicate, the query will use the primary index.
The simplest predicate is `WHERE _leading-index-key_ IS NOT MISSING`.
This is usually only necessary in queries which do not otherwise have a WHERE clause; for example, some GROUP BY and aggregate queries.

NOTE: The `WHERE` clause is faster because `WHERE` gets processed _before_ any `GROUP BY` and doesn't have access to aggregated values.
`HAVING` gets processed _after_ `GROUP BY` and is used to constrain the resultset to only those with aggregated values.

NOTE: The `CASE` expression categorizes each landmark into the Western hemisphere if its longitude is negative, or the Eastern hemisphere otherwise.
The alias in the `GROUP BY` clause enables you to refer to the `CASE` expression in the `SELECT` clause.
