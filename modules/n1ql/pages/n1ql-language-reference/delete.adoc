== Prerequisites

=== RBAC Privileges

To execute the DELETE statement, you must have the _Query Delete_ privilege granted on the target keyspace.
If the statement has any RETURNING clauses that need data read, then the _Query Select_ privilege is also required on the keyspaces referred in the respective clauses.
For more details about user roles, see {authorization-overview}[].

[[keyspace-ref]]
==== Keyspace Reference

[source,ebnf]

Keyspace reference for the delete target.
For more details, refer to {from-keyspace-ref}[Keyspace Reference].

[[delete-alias]]
==== AS Alias

Assigns another name to the keyspace reference.
For details, refer to {as-clause}[AS Clause].

Assigning an alias to the keyspace reference is optional.
If you assign an alias to the keyspace reference, the `AS` keyword may be omitted.

[[delete-hint]]
=== Delete Hint

You can use a `USE KEYS` hint on the delete target to specify the keys of the data items to be deleted.
For details, refer to {use-keys-clause}[USE KEYS Clause].

[[where-clause]]
=== WHERE Clause

[source,ebnf]
----
include::partial$grammar/dql.ebnf[tag=where-clause]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/where-clause.png["Syntax diagram: refer to source code listing", align=left]

Specifies the condition that needs to be met for data to be deleted.
Optional.

[[limit-clause]]
=== LIMIT Clause

[source,ebnf]
----
include::partial$grammar/dql.ebnf[tag=limit-clause]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/limit-clause.png["Syntax diagram: refer to source code listing", align=left]

Specifies the greatest number of objects that can be deleted.
This clause must have a non-negative integer as its upper bound.
Optional.

[[offset-clause]]
=== OFFSET Clause

[source,ebnf]
----
include::partial$grammar/dql.ebnf[tag=offset-clause]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/offset-clause.png["Syntax diagram: refer to source code listing", align=left]

Like the xref:n1ql-language-reference/offset.adoc[OFFSET clause] for a SELECT query, you can include an OFFSET clause in a DELETE statement to specify a number of objects to skip before beginning the deletion.
This option can be useful for parallelizing a large delete operation.

You can include the OFFSET clause either before or after the optional LIMIT clause. 
The position has no effect on the result.

The expression for this clause must be a non-negative integer.
Optional.

[[returning-clause]]
=== RETURNING Clause

[source,ebnf]
----
include::partial$grammar/dml.ebnf[tag=returning-clause]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/returning-clause.png["Syntax diagram: refer to source code listing", align=left]

Specifies the information to be returned by the operation as a query result.
For more details, refer to {returning-clause}[RETURNING Clause].

.Delete with LIMIT and OFFSET
====
This example deletes a subset of the airlines with a country of "France'.
First, you query to get a list of the airlines in France.

[source,sqlpp]
----
include::example$dml/delete-offset-before.n1ql[]
----

There are 21 documents in this collection with `country="France"`.

.Results
[source,text]
----
include::example$dml/delete-offset-before.jsonc[]
----

<.> The 10th document's id.
<.> The 20th document's id.

Next, you specify that you want to delete up to 10 documents, after skipping the first 10.

[source,sqlpp]
----
include::example$dml/delete-offset.n1ql[]
----

Now there are 11 documents in this collection with `country="France"`.

.Results
[source,text]
----
include::example$dml/delete-offset.jsonc[]
----

<.> Documents with the first 10 ids--the offset--remain in the airline collection.
<.> After deleting 10 documents--the limit--1 more document remains in the collection.
