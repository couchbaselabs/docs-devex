Search functions enable you to use xref:search:search.adoc[Full Text Search (FTS)] queries directly within a {sqlpp} query.

[float]
=== Prerequisites

To use any of the search functions, the Search Service must be available on the cluster.
It's recommended that you create a suitable Search index for the searches that you want to run.
For more information, refer to xref:search:create-search-indexes.adoc[].

[NOTE]
--
The examples in this page all assume that demonstration Search indexes have been created, as described in xref:server:fts:fts-demonstration-indexes.adoc[Demonstration Indexes].
--

[float]
=== Authorization

You do not need credentials for the Search Service to be able to use the search functions in a query.
The role *Data Admin* must be assigned to those who intend to create indexes; and the role *Data Reader* to those who intend to perform searches.
For information on creating users and roles in Capella, see xref:organizations:organization-projects-overview.adoc[].

[float]
=== When to Use Search Functions

The search functions are useful when you need to combine a Full Text Search with the power of a {sqlpp} query; for example, combining joins and natural-language search in the same query.

If you only need to use the capabilities of a Full Text Search without any {sqlpp} features, consider making use of the Search Service directly, through the user interface, the REST API, or an SDK.

[[search,SEARCH()]]
== SEARCH(`identifier`, `query`[, `options`])

=== Description

This function enables you to use a Full Text Search to filter a result set, or as a join predicate.
It is only allowed in the xref:n1ql-language-reference/where.adoc[WHERE] clause or the xref:n1ql-language-reference/join.adoc[ON] clause.

If a query contains a SEARCH function, the Query engine analyzes the entire query, including the search specification, to select the best index to use with this search, taking any index hints into account.
The Query engine then passes the search specification over to the Search engine to perform the search.

[TIP]
--
If no suitable Search index can be selected, or no Search index exists, the Query engine falls back on a Primary index or qualified GSI index to produce document keys, and then fetches the documents.
The Search Service then creates a temporary index in memory to perform the search.
This process may be slower than using a suitable Search index.
--

NOTE: From Couchbase Server 7.6 and later, when you use the SEARCH function, you do not need to use the xref:search:default-analyzers-reference.adoc#keyword[keyword analyzer] in your Search index to run a non-analytic query. 
You also do not need to match the analyzer in a query to the analyzer in the Search index for an analytic query. 
For more information about how to set the analyzer for a Search index, see xref:search:set-advanced-settings.adoc[] or the xref:search:search-index-params.adoc#mapping[Mapping Object].

=== Arguments

identifier::
[Required] An expression in the form `__keyspaceAlias__[.__path__]`, consisting of the keyspace or keyspace alias in which to search, followed by the path to a field in which to search, using dot notation.
+
[NOTE]
--
* The identifier must contain the keyspace or keyspace alias if there is more than one input source in the FROM clause.
If there is only one input source in the FROM clause, and the identifier contains a path, the keyspace or keyspace alias may be omitted.
However, if the path is omitted, the keyspace or keyspace alias is mandatory.

* When the identifier contains a path, it is used as the default field in the _query_ argument, as long as the _query_ argument is a query string.
If the path is omitted, the default field is set to `{underscore}all`.
If the _query_ argument is a query string which specifies a field, this field takes priority, and the path in the identifier is ignored.
Similarly, if the _query_ argument is a query object, the path is ignored.

* The path must use Search syntax rather than {sqlpp} syntax; in other words, you cannot specify array locations such as `[*]` or `[3]` in the path.

* If the keyspace, keyspace alias, or path contains any characters such as `-`, you must surround that part of the identifier with backticks `{backtick}{backtick}`.
--
+
The _identifier_ argument cannot be replaced by a {sqlpp} query parameter.

query::
[Required] The Full Text Search query.
This may be one of the following:
+
[cols="1a,4a", options="header"]
|===
| Type
| Description

| string
| A query string.
For more information about how to format a query string, refer to xref:search:search-request-params.adoc#query-string-query-syntax[Query String Query].

| object
| The `query` object within a Full Text Search request.
For more information about how to format the `query` object, see xref:search:search-request-params.adoc#query-object[Query object].

| object
| A complete Full Text Search request, including sort and pagination options, and so on.
For more information about how to format a full search request object, refer to xref:search:search-request-params.adoc[].

[NOTE]
====
When specifying a complete Full Text Search request with the {sqlpp} SEARCH() function, if the value of the `size` parameter is greater than the xref:server:fts:fts-response-object-schema.adoc#request[maximum number of Full Text Search results], the query ignores the `size` parameter and returns all matching results.

This is different to the behavior of a complete Full Text Search request in the Search Service, where the query returns an error if the value of the `size` parameter is greater than the maximum number of Full Text Search results.
====
|===
+
The _query_ argument may be replaced by a {sqlpp} query parameter, as long as the query parameter resolves to a string or an object.

options::
[Optional] A JSON object containing options for the search.
The object may contain the following fields:
+
[cols="1a,1a,3a", options="header"]
|===
| Name
| Type
| Description

| `index`
[Optional]
| string, object
| The `index` field can be a string, containing the name of a Search index in the keyspace.
(This might be a Search index alias, but only if the Search index is in the same keyspace.)
This provides an index hint to the Query engine.
If the Search index does not exist, an error occurs.

[TIP]
--
You can also provide an index hint to the Query engine with the xref:n1ql-language-reference/hints.adoc#use-index-clause[USE INDEX clause].
This takes precedence over a hint provided by the `index` field.
--

'''

The `index` field may also be an object, containing an example of a Search index mapping.
This is treated as an input to the index mapping.
It overrides the default mapping and is used during index selection and filtering.

The object must either have a default mapping with no type mapping, or a single type mapping with the default mapping disabled.
For more information, refer to xref:search:customize-index.adoc[].

| `indexUUID`
[Optional]
| string
| A string, containing the xref:search:search-index-params.adoc#uuid[UUID] of a Search index in the keyspace.
This provides an index hint to the Query engine.
If the Search index cannot be identified, an error occurs.

You can use the `indexUUID` field alongside the `index` field to help identify a Search index.
The `indexUUID` field and the `index` field must both identify the same Search index.
If they identify different Search indexes, or if either of them does not identify a Search index, an error occurs.

You can find the UUID of a Search index by viewing the index definition.
Click a Search index name in the Capella UI to open the editor. 
Click btn:[Index Definition] to view the index definition.

| `out`
[Optional]
| string
| A name given to this Full Text Search operation in this keyspace.
You can use this name to refer to this operation using the <<search_meta>> and <<search_score>> functions.
If this field is omitted, the name of this Full Text Search operation defaults to `"out"`.

| (other)
[Optional]
| (any)
| Other fields are ignored by the Query engine and are passed on to the Search engine as options.
The values of these options may be replaced with {sqlpp} query parameters, such as `"analyzer": $analyzer`.
|===

+
The _options_ argument cannot be replaced by a {sqlpp} query parameter, but it may contain {sqlpp} query parameters.

=== Return Value

A boolean, representing whether the search query is found within the input path.

This returns `true` if the search query is found within the input path, or `false` otherwise.

=== Limitations

The Query service can select a Search index for efficient search in the following cases:

* If the SEARCH() function is used in a WHERE clause or in an ANSI JOIN.
The SEARCH() function must be on the leftmost (first) JOIN.
It may be on the outer side of a nested-loop JOIN, or either side of a hash JOIN.
RIGHT OUTER JOINs are rewritten as LEFT OUTER JOINs.

* If the SEARCH() function is evaluated on the `true` condition in positive cases: for example, `SEARCH(_field_, _query_, _options_)`, `SEARCH(_field_, _query_, _options_) = true`, `SEARCH(_field_, _query_, _options_) IN [true, true, true]`, or a condition including one of these with `AND` or `OR`.

The Query service cannot select a Search index for efficient search in the following cases:

* If a USE KEYS hint is present; or if the SEARCH() function is used on the inner side of a nested-loop JOIN, a lookup JOIN or lookup NEST, an index JOIN or index NEST, an UNNEST clause, a subquery expression, a subquery result, or a correlated query.

* If the SEARCH() function is evaluated on the `false` condition, or in negative cases: for example, `NOT SEARCH(_field_, _query_, _options_)`, `SEARCH(_field_, _query_, _options_) = false`, `SEARCH(_field_, _query_, _options_) != false`, `SEARCH(_field_, _query_, _options_) IN [false, true, 1, "a"]`, or in a condition using the relation operators `<`, `{lt}=`, `>`, `>=`, `BETWEEN`, `NOT`, `LIKE`, or `NOT LIKE`.

In these cases, the Query service must fetch the documents, and the Search service creates a temporary index in memory to perform the search.
This may affect performance.

If the SEARCH() function is present for a keyspace, no GSI covering scan is possible on that keyspace.
If more than one FTS or GSI index are used in the plan, IntersectScan or Ordered IntersectScan is performed.
To avoid this, use a USE INDEX hint.

Order pushdown is possible only if query ORDER BY has only <<search_score>> on the leftmost keyspace.
Offset and Limit pushdown is possible if the query only has a SEARCH() predicate, using a single search index -- no IntersectScan or OrderIntersectScan.
Group aggregates and projection are not pushed.

.Search using a query string
====
The following queries are equivalent:

.Query
[source,sqlpp]
----
SELECT META(t1).id
FROM airline AS t1
WHERE SEARCH(t1.country, "+United +States");
----

.Query
[source,sqlpp]
----
SELECT META(t1).id
FROM airline AS t1
WHERE SEARCH(t1, "country:\"United States\"");
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
[
 
  {
    "id": "airline_10"
  },
  {
    "id": "airline_10123"
  },
  {
    "id": "airline_10226"
  },
  {
    "id": "airline_10748"
  },
  // ...
]
----

The results are unordered, so they may be returned in a different order each time.
====

.Search using a query object
====
.Query
[source,sqlpp]
----
SELECT t1.name
FROM hotel AS t1
WHERE SEARCH(t1, {
  "match": "bathrobes",
  "field": "reviews.content",
  "analyzer": "standard"
});
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "name": "Typoeth Cottage"
  },
  {
    "name": "Great Orme Lighthouse"
  },
  {
    "name": "New Road Guest House (B&B)"
  },
  // ...
]
----

The results are unordered, so they may be returned in a different order each time.
====

.Search using a complete Full Text Search request
====
.Query
[source,sqlpp]
----
SELECT t1.name
FROM hotel AS t1
WHERE SEARCH(t1, {
  "explain": false,
  "fields": [
     "*"
   ],
   "highlight": {},
   "query": {
     "match": "bathrobes",
     "field": "reviews.content",
     "analyzer": "standard"
   },
   "size" : 5,
   "sort": [
      {
       "by" : "field",
       "field" : "reviews.ratings.Overall",
       "mode" : "max",
       "missing" : "last"
      }
   ]
});
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "name": "Waunifor"
  },
  {
    "name": "Bistro Prego With Rooms"
  },
  {
    "name": "Thornehill Broome Beach Campground"
  },
  // ...
]
----

This query returns 5 results, and the results are ordered, as specified by the search options.
As an alternative, you could limit the number of results and order them using the {sqlpp} xref:n1ql-language-reference/limit.adoc[LIMIT] and xref:n1ql-language-reference/orderby.adoc[ORDER BY] clauses.
====

.Search against a Full Text Search index that carries a custom type mapping
====
.Query
[source,sqlpp]
----
SELECT META(t1).id
FROM hotel AS t1
WHERE t1.type = "hotel" AND SEARCH(t1.description, "amazing");
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "id": "hotel_20422"
  },
  {
    "id": "hotel_22096"
  },
  {
    "id": "hotel_25243"
  },
  {
    "id": "hotel_27741"
  }
]
----

If the Full Text Search index being queried has its default mapping disabled and has a custom type mapping defined, the query needs to specify the type explicitly.
The above query uses the demonstration index xref:server:fts:fts-demonstration-indexes.adoc#travel-sample-index-hotel-description[travel-sample-index-hotel-description], which has the custom type mapping "hotel".

For more information about defining custom type mappings within a Search index, refer to xref:search:create-type-mapping.adoc[Create a Type Mapping].
Note that for {sqlpp} queries, only Search indexes with one type mapping are searchable.
Also the supported type identifiers at the moment are "type_field" and "docid_prefix"; "docid_regexp" isn't supported yet for SEARCH queries via {sqlpp}.
====

.Search against a Vector Search index for the closest 2 vectors
====
NOTE: This example does not use the travel sample data or query context mentioned before, as it requires documents that contain vector data. 

.Query
[source,sqlpp]
----
SELECT t1.color
FROM rgb AS t1
WHERE SEARCH(t1, 
  { 
    "fields": ["*"], 
    "query": { 
      "match_none": "" 
    }, 
    "knn": [ 
      { 
        "k": 2, 
        "field": "colorvect_dot", 
        "vector": [ 0.707106781186548, 0, 0.707106781186548 ]
      }
    ]
  }
)
----

.Results
----
[
  {
    "color": "magenta / fuchsia"
  },
  {
    "color": "dark lavender"
  }
]
----
Using a Search index that contains vectors that describe colors, the query returns the color names of the closest `k` vectors to the vector in the `knn` object.

====

[[search_meta,SEARCH_META()]]
== SEARCH_META([`identifier`])

=== Description

This function is intended to be used in a query which contains a <<search>> function.
It returns the metadata given by the Search engine for each document found by the <<search>> function.
If there is no <<search>> function in the query, or if a Search index was not used to evaluate the search, the function returns MISSING.

=== Arguments

identifier::
[Optional] An expression in the form `{startsb}__keyspaceAlias__.{endsb}__outname__`, consisting of the keyspace or keyspace alias in which the Full Text Search operation was performed, followed by the outname of the Full Text Search operation, using dot notation.

[NOTE]
--
* The identifier must contain the keyspace or keyspace alias if there is more than one input source in the FROM clause.
If there is only one input source in the FROM clause, the keyspace or keyspace alias may be omitted.

* The identifier must contain the outname if there is more than one <<search>> function in the query.
If there is only one <<search>> function in the query, the identifier may be omitted altogether.

* The outname is specified by the `out` field within the <<search>> function's _options_ argument.
If an outname was not specified by the <<search>> function, the outname defaults to `"out"`.

* If the keyspace or keyspace alias contains any characters such as `-`, you must surround that part of the identifier with backticks `{backtick}{backtick}`.
--

=== Return Value

A JSON object containing the metadata returned by the Search engine.
By default, the metadata includes the score and ID of the search result.
It may also include other metadata requested by advanced search options, such as the location of the search terms or an explanation of the search results.

=== Examples

[[search_score,SEARCH_SCORE()]]
== SEARCH_SCORE([`identifier`])

=== Description

This function is intended to be used in a query which contains a <<search>> function.
It returns the score given by the Search engine for each document found by the <<search>> function.
If there is no <<search>> function in the query, or if a Search index was not used to evaluate the search, the function returns MISSING.

This function is the same as <<search_meta,SEARCH_META().score>>.

=== Arguments

identifier::
[Optional] An expression in the form `{startsb}__keyspaceAlias__.{endsb}__outname__`, consisting of the keyspace or keyspace alias in which the Full Text Search operation was performed, followed by the outname of the Full Text Search operation, using dot notation.

[NOTE]
--
* The identifier must contain the keyspace or keyspace alias if there is more than one input source in the FROM clause.
If there is only one input source in the FROM clause, the keyspace or keyspace alias may be omitted.

* The identifier must contain the outname if there is more than one <<search>> function in the query.
If there is only one <<search>> function in the query, the identifier may be omitted altogether.

* The outname is specified by the `out` field within the <<search>> function's _options_ argument.
If an outname was not specified by the <<search>> function, the outname defaults to `"out"`.

* If the keyspace or keyspace alias contains any characters such as `-`, you must surround that part of the identifier with backticks `{backtick}{backtick}`.
