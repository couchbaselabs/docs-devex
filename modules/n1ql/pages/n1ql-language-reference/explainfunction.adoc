{description}

You can supply the name of an inline or external user-defined function.

* For an inline function, EXPLAIN FUNCTION returns the query plans for all of the subqueries present in the function body.
+
For more information about inline functions, see xref:n1ql-language-reference/userfun.adoc[].

* For an external function, EXPLAIN FUNCTION returns the query plans for all embedded {sqlpp} queries inside the referenced JavaScript body, or the line number on which a N1QL() call appears.
Line numbers are calculated from the beginning of the JavaScript function definition.
+
For more information about user-defined functions with JavaScript, see xref:guides:javascript-udfs.adoc[].

The following constraints apply:

* If a user-defined function itself contains other, nested user-defined function executions, EXPLAIN FUNCTION generates the query plan for the specified function only, and not for its nested {sqlpp} queries.

* If an external function defines an alias for a N1QL() call, EXPLAIN FUNCTION cannot return its line number.

== Prerequisites

To execute EXPLAIN FUNCTION on an inline user-defined function, you must have the necessary execute function permission on that function. 

* For a global internal function, you must have the Execute Global Functions role. 

* For a scoped internal function, you must have the Execute Scope Functions role, with permissions on the specified bucket and scope.

To execute EXPLAIN FUNCTION on an external user-defined JavaScript function, you must have the necessary execute external function permission on that function. 

* For a global JavaScript function, you must have the Execute Global External Functions role. 

* For a scoped JavaScript function, you must have the Execute External Scope Functions role, with permissions on the specified bucket and scope.

You must also have the necessary privileges required for the {sqlpp} statements inside the function.

For more information about user roles, see
xref:learn:security/authorization-overview.adoc[Authorization].

The statement consists of the `EXPLAIN FUNCTION` keywords followed by the name of the user-defined function that has the execution plan you want to review.

For more information about function name syntax and requirements, see xref:n1ql-language-reference/createfunction.adoc#inline-name[CREATE FUNCTION].

== Examples

.Inline Function Example

====
In this example, you create an inline function named `func1` and then request the plan for its subquery.

[source,sqlpp]
----
include::n1ql:example$utility/explainfunction.n1ql[]
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
include::n1ql:example$utility/explainfunction.jsonc[]
----
====

.External Function Example

====
This example assumes that you have defined a JavaScript library named  `lib1`.

You then add a JavaScript function named `function1` to that library as follows:

[source,javascript]
----
include::n1ql:example$utility/explainfunctionjs.js[]
----

<.> An embedded {sqlpp} statement.
<.> A N1QL() call that executes a {sqlpp} statement.

You then create the corresponding {sqlpp} user-defined function for that JavaScript function, named `jsfunction1`, and request the plan information for the statements within the function definition:

[source,SQL++]
----
include::n1ql:example$utility/explainfunctionjs.n1ql[]
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
include::n1ql:example$utility/explainfunctionjs.jsonc[]
----

<.> The line number in the JavaScript function that includes a N1QL() call. 
<.> The query plan for the embedded {sqlpp} statement.
