= EXPLAIN FUNCTION
:description: For a specified user-defined function, you use EXPLAIN FUNCTION to expose the execution plan for the {sqlpp} subqueries or embedded statements that it contains.

== Purpose

You can request the execution plan for an inline or external user-defined function.

* For an inline function, EXPLAIN FUNCTION returns the query plans for all of the subqueries present in the function body.
+
For more information about inline functions, see xref:n1ql-language-reference/userfun.adoc[].

* For an external function, EXPLAIN FUNCTION returns the query plans for all embedded {sqlpp} queries inside the referenced JavaScript body, or the line number on which a N1QL() call appears.
Line numbers are calculated from the beginning of the JavaScript function definition.
+
For more information about user-defined functions with JavaScript, see xref:guides:javascript-udfs.adoc[].

The following constraints apply:

* If a user-defined function itself contains other, nested user-defined function executions, EXPLAIN FUNCTION generates the query plan for the specified function only, and not for its nested {sqlpp} queries.

* If an external function defines an alias for a N1QL() call, EXPLAIN FUNCTION cannot return its line number.

== Prerequisites

[cols="2,3"]
|===
| To execute EXPLAIN FUNCTION on ... | You must have ...

| Global inline functions
| *Execute Global Functions* role.

| Scoped inline functions
| *Execute Scope Functions* role, with permissions on the specified bucket and scope.

| Global external functions
| *Execute Global External Functions* role.

| Scoped external functions
| *Execute Scope External Functions* role, with permissions on the specified bucket and scope.
|===

You must also have the necessary privileges required for the {sqlpp} statements inside the function.

=== Function Name

The name of the function.
This is usually an unqualified identifier, such as `func1` or `{backtick}func-1{backtick}`.
In this case, the path to the function is determined by the current xref:n1ql:n1ql-intro/queriesandresults.adoc#query-context[query context].

To get the plan for a global function in a particular namespace, the function name must be a qualified identifier with a namespace, such as `default:func1`.
Similarly, to get the plan for a scoped function in a particular scope, the function name must be a qualified identifier with the full path to a scope, such as `default:{backtick}travel-sample{backtick}.inventory.func1`.
Refer to xref:n1ql-language-reference/createfunction.adoc#context[Global Functions and Scoped Functions] for more information.

NOTE: The name of a user-defined function _is_ case-sensitive, unlike that of a built-in function.
You must get the plan for the user-defined function using the same case that was used when it was created.

== Examples

.Inline Function Example
====
In this example, you create an inline function named `func1` and then request the plan for its subquery.

[source,sqlpp]
----
include::n1ql:example$utility/explainfunction.n1ql[]
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
include::n1ql:example$utility/explainfunction.jsonc[]
----
====

.External Function Example
====
This example assumes that you have defined a JavaScript library named  `lib1`.

You then add a JavaScript function named `function1` to that library as follows:

[source,javascript]
----
include::n1ql:example$utility/explainfunctionjs.js[]
----

<.> An embedded {sqlpp} statement.
<.> A N1QL() call that executes a {sqlpp} statement.

You then create the corresponding {sqlpp} user-defined function for that JavaScript function, named `jsfunction1`, and request the plan information for the statements within the function definition:

[source,SQL++]
----
include::n1ql:example$utility/explainfunctionjs.n1ql[]
----

.Results
[source,json]
----
include::n1ql:example$utility/explainfunctionjs.jsonc[]
----

<.> The line number in the JavaScript function that includes a N1QL() call.
<.> The query plan for the embedded {sqlpp} statement.
