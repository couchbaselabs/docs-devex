[abstract]
The `EXECUTE FUNCTION` statement enables you to execute a user-defined function.

== Purpose

The `EXECUTE FUNCTION` statement enables you to execute a user-defined function.
It is useful for testing user-defined functions outside the context of a query.
It also enables you to execute functions which have side effects, such as performing mutations, which is not possible when calling a user-defined function in an expression.

You cannot use the `EXECUTE FUNCTION` statement to execute a built-in {sqlpp} function.
If you do this, error `10101: Function not found` is generated.

== Prerequisites

|===
| To execute ... | You must have ...

| Global inline functions
| *Execute Global Functions* role.

| Scoped inline functions
| *Execute Scope Functions* role, with permissions on the specified bucket and scope.

| Global external functions
| *Execute Global External Functions* role.

| Scoped external functions
| *Execute Scope External Functions* role, with permissions on the specified bucket and scope.

[[name]]
=== Function Name

The name of the function.
This is usually an unqualified identifier, such as `func1` or `{backtick}func-1{backtick}`.
In this case, the path to the function is determined by the current xref:n1ql:n1ql-intro/queriesandresults.adoc#query-context[query context].

To execute a global function in a particular namespace, the function name must be a qualified identifier with a namespace, such as `default:func1`.
Similarly, to execute a scoped function in a particular scope, the function name must be a qualified identifier with the full path to a scope, such as `default:{backtick}travel-sample{backtick}.inventory.func1`.
Refer to xref:n1ql-language-reference/createfunction.adoc#context[Global Functions and Scoped Functions] for more information.

NOTE: The name of a user-defined function _is_ case-sensitive, unlike that of a built-in function.
You must execute the user-defined function using the same case that was used when it was created.

[[expression]]
=== Arguments

[Optional] Comma-separated expressions specify arguments for the function.
If the function was created with named parameters, you must supply all the arguments that were specified when the function was created.
If the function was created without named parameters, you cannot supply an argument.
If the function is variadic, you can supply as many arguments as needed, or none.
