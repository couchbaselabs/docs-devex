=== Function Name

[source,ebnf]
----
include::partial$grammar/ddl.ebnf[tag=function]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/function.png["Syntax diagram: refer to source code listing", align=left]

The name of the function.
This is usually an unqualified identifier, such as `func1` or `{backtick}func-1{backtick}`.
In this case, the path to the function is determined by the current xref:n1ql:n1ql-intro/queriesandresults.adoc#query-context[query context].

To delete a global function in a particular namespace, the function name must be a qualified identifier with a namespace, such as `default:func1`.
Similarly, to delete a scoped function in a particular scope, the function name must be a qualified identifier with the full path to a scope, such as `default:{backtick}travel-sample{backtick}.inventory.func1`.
Refer to xref:n1ql-language-reference/createfunction.adoc#context[Global Functions and Scoped Functions] for more information.

NOTE: The name of a user-defined function _is_ case-sensitive, unlike that of a built-in function.
You must delete the user-defined function using the same case that was used when it was created.

=== IF EXISTS Clause

The optional `IF EXISTS` clause enables the statement to complete successfully when the specified function doesn't exist.

When the function does not exist within the specified context:
footnote:context[That is, you are dropping a global function, and the function does not exist within the specified namespace; or, you are dropping a scoped function, and the function does not exist within the specified scope.]

* If this clause is not present, an error is generated.

* If this clause is present, the statement does nothing and completes without error.

== Usage

When you drop a user-defined function whose definition is stored in an external library, the external library and function on which the user-defined function depended are not deleted.
This enables you to create a new user-defined function with a different name, or a different number of parameters, using the same JavaScript library and function.

To change or delete an external library or the external function code, you must use the xref:tools:udfs-ui.adoc[Query Workbench] or the {sqlpp} xref:n1ql-rest-api/functions.adoc[Functions REST API].

When you drop a {sqlpp} managed user-defined function, the associated external function code is deleted also.

== Examples

.Drop an inline function
====
This statement deletes an inline function called `celsius`.

[source,sqlpp]
----
DROP FUNCTION celsius;
----

You can run the following query to check that the function is no longer available.

[source,sqlpp]
----
SELECT * FROM system:functions;
----
====

.Drop a {sqlpp} managed user-defined function
====
This statement deletes a {sqlpp} managed user-defined function called `add100`.

[source,sqlpp]
----
DROP FUNCTION add100 IF EXISTS;
----

You can run the following query to check that the function is no longer available.

[source,sqlpp]
----
SELECT * FROM system:functions;
----
====

.Drop an external function
====
These statements delete two external functions:

. A function called `geohash`, which depends on the JavaScript `encodeGeoHash` function in the `geohash-js` library;
. A function called `adjacent`, which depends on the JavaScript `calculateAdjacent` function in the `geohash-js` library.

[source,sqlpp]
----
DROP FUNCTION geohash;

DROP FUNCTION adjacent;
----

You can run the following command to check that the JavaScript `geohash-js` library and the `encodeGeoHash` and `calculateAdjacent` functions are still available.

[source,sh]
----
curl -v -X GET \
http://localhost:8093/evaluator/v1/libraries/geohash-js \
-u Administrator:password
