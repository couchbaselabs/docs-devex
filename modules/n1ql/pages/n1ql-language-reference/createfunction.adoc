== Purpose

There are two types of user-defined function:

* [def]_Inline functions_ are defined using {sqlpp} expressions.
They enable you to name and reuse complex or repetitive expressions, including subqueries, in order to simplify your queries.

* [def]_External functions_ are defined using an external language.
They enable you to create functions that may be difficult or impossible to define using built-in {sqlpp} expressions.
The only supported language is JavaScript.

External functions in {sqlpp} support most of the language constructs available in ECMAScript.
For more information about the restrictions and extensions that come with the Couchbase implementation, see xref:javascript-udfs:javascript-functions-with-couchbase.adoc[].

[[context]]
=== Global Functions and Scoped Functions

You can create user-defined functions at two different levels of the {sqlpp} xref:n1ql-intro/queriesandresults.adoc#logical-hierarchy[logical hierarchy].

* A [def]_global function_ is created within a namespace, at the same level as the buckets within the namespace.
When you call a global function, any partial keyspace references within the function definition are resolved against the function's namespace, regardless of the current xref:n1ql:n1ql-intro/queriesandresults.adoc#query-context[query context].
+
For example, when you call a global function `default:global()` which contains the keyspace reference `{backtick}travel-sample{backtick}`, the keyspace reference is always resolved within the context of the function to the `default:{backtick}travel-sample{backtick}` bucket.

* A [def]_scoped function_ is created within a scope, at the same level as the collections within the scope.
When you call a scoped function, any partial keyspace references within the function definition are resolved against the function's scope, regardless of the current xref:n1ql:n1ql-intro/queriesandresults.adoc#query-context[query context].
+
For example, when you call a scoped function `default:{backtick}travel-sample{backtick}.inventory.scope()` which contains the keyspace reference `route`, the keyspace reference is always resolved within the context of the function to `default:{backtick}travel-sample{backtick}.inventory.route`.

When you create a user-defined function, the current query context determines whether it is created as a global function or a scoped function.
If you want to create a user-defined function outside of the current query context, you must include the full path to the function when you specify the function name.

Similarly, when you call a user-defined function, the current query context determines the path to the function.
If you want to call a user-defined function outside of the current query context, you must include the full path to the function when you specify the function name.

Finally, it is important to note that a global function is _not_ the same as a scoped function stored in the default scope in a bucket.

=== External Libraries

(((library namespacing)))
You can store external functions in _libraries_.
This enables you to share external function code in more than one user-defined function.

You must create the external library and the external function code using the xref:tools:udfs-ui.adoc[Query Workbench] or the {sqlpp} xref:n1ql-rest-api/functions.adoc[Functions REST API].

Like user-defined functions, these libraries may also be scoped or global.
This enables you to keep the code for external functions separate where required.

Code which is stored in a _scoped library_ is private to users of that scope, and is not visible or available to users of another scope.
Code which is stored in a _global library_ is available to users of all scopes.

A global library may have the same name as a scoped library, and scoped libraries may have the same name as each other.
For example, you may have a global `math` library, and a `math` library in each scope.

=== {sqlpp} Managed User-Defined Functions

ifeval::['{page-component-version}' == '7.6']
_(Introduced in Couchbase Server 7.6)_
endif::[]

In Couchbase Server 7.6 and later, you can create the code for an external function and the corresponding {sqlpp} user-defined function in a single operation.
This means that you don't have to specify an external library and create the code for the external function, before creating the {sqlpp} user-defined function.

With a {sqlpp} managed user-defined function, the external function code is stored inline, along with the {sqlpp} user-defined function.
You cannot share this external function code with other user-defined functions, or access it from any external libraries.

== Syntax

The `CREATE FUNCTION` statement takes a different syntax depending on the type of function you are creating.
Refer to <<create-function-inline>> or <<create-function-external>> below.

[[create-function-inline]]
:section: inline
=== Inline Functions

There are two alternative syntaxes for defining an inline function: a syntax with braces `{}` and a syntax using the `LANGUAGE` keyword.
The two syntaxes are synonymous.

function:: <<inline-name>> icon:caret-down[]
params:: <<inline-parameter>> icon:caret-down[]
body:: <<inline-expression>> icon:caret-down[]

// tag::replace[]
[id='{section}-replace']
==== OR REPLACE / IF NOT EXISTS

The optional `OR REPLACE` clause enables you to redefine a user-defined function if it already exists, whereas the optional `IF NOT EXISTS` clause enables the statement to complete successfully without replacing the function.

When a function with the same name already exists within the same context:
footnote:context[That is, you are creating a global function, and a function with the same name already exists within the same namespace; or, you are creating a scoped function, and a function with the same name already exists within the same scope.]

* If the `OR REPLACE` clause is present, the existing function is replaced.

* If the `IF NOT EXISTS` clause is present, the statement does nothing and completes without error.

* If neither of these two clauses is present, an error is generated.

NOTE: These clauses are exclusive.
If the statement contains both the `OR REPLACE` clause and the `IF NOT EXISTS` clause, an error is generated.

// end::replace[]

// tag::arguments[]
[id='{section}-name']
==== Function Name

[source,ebnf]
----
include::partial$grammar/ddl.ebnf[tag=function]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/function.png["Syntax diagram: refer to source code listing", align=left]

The function name specifies the name of the function to create.
It is recommended to use an unqualified identifier for the function name, such as `func1` or `{backtick}func-1{backtick}`.
In this case, the function is created as a global function or a scoped function, depending on the current query context.

To create a global function in a particular namespace, the function name must be a qualified identifier with a namespace, such as `default:func1`.
Similarly, to create a scoped function in a particular scope, the function name must be a qualified identifier with the full path to a scope, such as `default:{backtick}travel-sample{backtick}.inventory.func1`.

If the function name is an unqualified identifier, it may not be the same as a reserved keyword.
A function name with a specified namespace or scope may have the same name as a reserved keyword.

[id='{section}-parameter']
==== Function Parameters

[source,ebnf]
----
include::partial$grammar/ddl.ebnf[tag=params]
----

image::n1ql-language-reference/params.png["Syntax diagram: refer to source code listing", align=left]

[Optional] The function parameter list specifies parameters for the function.
If you specify named parameters for the function, then you must call the function with exactly the same number of arguments at execution time.
If you specify no parameters, then you must call the function with no arguments.
To create a variadic function, that is, a function which you can call with any number of arguments or none, specify `\...` as the only parameter.
// end::arguments[]

[[inline-expression]]
==== Function Body

The function body defines the function.
You can use any valid {sqlpp} expression.
If you specified named parameters for the function, you can use these in the expression to represent arguments passed to the function at execution time.
If you specified that the function is variadic, any arguments passed to the function at execution time are held in an array named `args`.

[NOTE]
====
* If the expression contains a parameter that has the same name as a field in the document, it will always refer to the parameter.
To distinguish between the field and the parameter, prefix the field with the keyspace name, for example `landmark.activity`.
To avoid this ambiguity, you should use unique parameter names that do not clash with document field names, such as `vActivity`.

* Functions may return only one value, of any valid {sqlpp} type.
For inline functions, the result and type of the function are the result and type of the expression.
If you need to return multiple values, construct an array.

[[create-function-external]]
:section: external
=== External Functions

There are two alternative syntaxes for defining an external function: one where the function code is stored in an external library, and one for creating a {sqlpp} managed user-defined function.

include::createfunction.adoc[tag=replace]

include::createfunction.adoc[tag=arguments]

[[external-object]]
==== External Object

[Optional] Use this parameter where the function code is stored in an external library.

The name of the JavaScript function that you want to use for the user-defined function.
This parameter is a string and must be wrapped in quotes.

[[external-library]]
==== External Library

[Optional] Use this parameter where the function code is stored in an external library.

The name of the JavaScript library that contains the JavaScript function you want to use.
This parameter is a string and must be wrapped in quotes.

The name of a scoped external library must include the bucket name, the scope name, and the library name, separated by slashes.
For example, to refer to a scoped library called `my-library` located in the `inventory` scope within the `travel-sample` bucket, you would specify the library name as `travel-sample/inventory/my-library`.

[[javascript]]
==== Function Body

[Optional] Use this parameter to create a {sqlpp} managed user-defined function.

The external JavaScript function code.
This must contain a function with the same name and the same number of parameters as the {sqlpp} user-defined function.
This parameter is a string and must be wrapped in quotes.

The JavaScript code can contain multiple function definitions, but these functions can only be referenced within the JavaScript code for this {sqlpp} user-defined function, and cannot be shared.

== Examples

For simplicity, none of these examples implement any data validation or error checking.
If necessary, you can use xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/conditionalops.adoc[conditional operators] to check the parameters of a user-defined function, and the xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/metafun.adoc#abort[ABORT()] function to generate an error if something is wrong.

[[ex-inline-language]]
.Inline function with the LANGUAGE syntax
====
This statement creates a function called `celsius`, which converts Fahrenheit to Celsius.
The function is variadic.

For purposes of illustration, this expression converts just the first argument supplied at execution time, which is stored in the first member in the `args` array.
A more realistic variadic function would make use of all the supplied arguments.

====
This statement creates a function called `fahrenheit`, which converts Celsius to Fahrenheit.
The function is variadic.

For purposes of illustration, this expression converts just the first argument supplied at execution time, which is stored in the first member in the `args` array.
A more realistic variadic function would make use of all the supplied arguments.

[source,sqlpp]

As the function is variadic, you can use any number of arguments when you call the function.
Arguments which are not used by the function expression are ignored.
====

[[ex-params-incorrect]]
.Inline function with named parameters
====
The following statement creates a function called `lstr`, which returns the specified number of characters from the left of a string.
The expression expects two named arguments: `vString`, which is the string to work with, and `vLen`, which is the number of characters to return.

[source,sqlpp]
----
CREATE FUNCTION lstr(vString, vLen) LANGUAGE INLINE AS SUBSTR(vString, 0, vLen);

As the arguments were specified by the function definition, you must use the same number of arguments when you call the function.
If you supply the wrong number of arguments, an error is generated.

footnote:[Credit: https://github.com/davetroy/geohash-js]

* The function `encodeGeoHash` takes two arguments, a latitude and a longitude, and returns the 12-character https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geohash[geohash^] for the specified location.
* The function `calculateAdjacent` takes two arguments, a geohash and a direction -- `"top"`, `"bottom"`, `"left"`, or `"right"` -- and returns the geohash of the location next to the original geohash in the specified direction.
