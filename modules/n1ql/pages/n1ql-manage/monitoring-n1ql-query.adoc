= Manage and Monitor Queries
:example-caption!:
:description: Monitoring and profiling {sqlpp} queries, query service nodes, and corresponding system resources is very important for smoother operational performance and efficiency of the system.

[abstract]
{description}
In fact, often it is vital for diagnosing and troubleshooting issues such as query performance, resource bottlenecks, and overloading of various services.

include::ROOT:partial$component-signpost.adoc[]

System keyspaces provide various monitoring details and statistics about individual queries and the Query service.
When running on a cluster with multiple query nodes, stats about all queries on all query nodes are collected in the Query management and monitoring system keyspaces.

For example, this can help identify:

* The top 10 slow or fast queries running on a particular query node or the cluster.
* Resource usage statistics of the query service, or resources used for a particular query.
* Details about the active, completed, and prepared queries.
* Find long running queries that are running for more than 2 minutes.

These system keyspaces are transient in nature, and are not persisted to disk or permanent storage.
Hence, the information in the keyspaces pertains to the current instantiation of the Query service.

You can access the Query management and monitoring system keyspaces using any of the following:

* {sqlpp} from the cbq shell or Query Workbench
* The Query Admin REST API
* A monitoring SDK

Using {sqlpp} enables you to obtain further insights from the keyspaces.

== Authentication and Client Privileges

Users must have the *Query System Catalog* role to access restricted system keyspaces.
For more details about user roles, see xref:learn:security/authorization-overview.adoc[Authorization].

== Examples on this Page

In the REST API examples:

* `$BASE_URL` is the protocol, host name or IP address, and port -- for example, `+http://localhost:8093+`.
* `$USER` is the user name.
* `$PASSWORD` is the password.

[#vitals]
== Monitor System Vitals

The `system:vitals` catalog provides data about the running state and health of the query nodes, such as number of logical cores, active threads, queued threads, CPU utilization, memory usage, network utilization, garbage collection percentage, and so on.
This information can be very useful to assess the current workload and performance characteristics of a query node.

[#sys-prepared]
== Monitor and Manage Prepared Statements

The `system:prepareds` catalog provides data about the known prepared statements and their state in a query node's prepared statement cache.
For each prepared statement, this catalog provides information such as name, statement, query plan, last use time, number of uses, and so on.

A prepared statement is created and stored relative to the current xref:n1ql:n1ql-intro/queriesandresults.adoc#query-context[query context].
You can create multiple prepared statements with the same name, each stored relative to a different query context.
This enables you to run multiple instances of the same application against different datasets.

When there are multiple prepared statements with the same name in different query contexts, the name of the prepared statement in the `system:prepareds` catalog includes the associated query context in brackets.

== Monitor and Manage Completed Requests

By default, the `system:completed_requests` catalog maintains a list of the most recent completed requests that have run longer than a predefined threshold of time.
(You can also log completed requests that meet other conditions that you define.)

For each completed request, this catalog maintains information such as requestId, statement text, prepared name (if prepared statement), request time, service time, and so on.
This information provides a general insight into the health and performance of the query node and the cluster.

[[sys-completed-config]]
== Configure the Completed Requests

You can configure the `system:completed_requests` keyspace by specifying parameters through the Admin API `/admin/settings` endpoint.

You can specify the conditions for completed request logging using the `completed` field.
This field takes a JSON object containing the names and values of logging qualifiers.
Completed requests that meet the defined qualifiers are logged.

[source,sh]
----
curl $BASE_URL/admin/settings -u $USER:$PASSWORD \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"completed": {"user": "marco", "error": 12003}}'
----

=== Logging Qualifiers

You can specify the following logging qualifiers.
A completed request is logged if _any_ of the qualifiers are met (logical OR).

[horizontal]
`threshold`:: The execution time threshold in milliseconds.
`aborted`:: Whether to log requests that generate a panic.
`error`:: Log requests returning this error number.
`client`:: Log requests from this IP address.
`user`:: Log requests with this user name.
`context`:: Log requests with this client context ID.

For full details, see xref:n1ql:n1ql-rest-api/admin.adoc#_logging_parameters[Logging parameters].

The basic syntax adds a qualifier to the logging parameters, i.e. any existing qualifiers are not removed.
You can change the value of a logging qualifier by specifying the same qualifier again with a new value.

To add a new instance of an existing qualifier, use a plus sign (`+`) before the qualifier name, e.g. `+user`.
To remove a qualifier, use a minus sign (`-`) before the qualifier name, e.g. `-user`.

For example, the following request will add user `simon` to those tracked, and remove error `12003`.

[source,sh]
----
curl $BASE_URL/admin/settings -u $USER:$PASSWORD \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"completed": {"+user": "simon", "-error": 12003}}'
----

Similarly, you could remove all logging by execution time with the following request, as long as the value matches the existing threshold.

[source,sh]
----
curl $BASE_URL/admin/settings -u $USER:$PASSWORD \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"completed": {"-threshold": 1000}}'
----

=== Tagged Sets

You can also specify qualifiers that have to be met as a group for the completed request to be logged (logical AND).

To do this, specify the `tag` field along with a set of qualifiers, like so:

[source,sh]
----
curl $BASE_URL/admin/settings -u $USER:$PASSWORD \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"completed": {"user": "marco", "error": 12003, "tag": "both_user_and_error"}}'
----

In this case, the request will be logged when both user and error match.

The tag name can be any string that is meaningful and unique.
Requests that match a tagged set of conditions are logged with a field `~tag`, which is set to the name of the tag.

To add a qualifier to a tagged set, specify the tag name again along with the new qualifier:

[source,sh]
----
curl $BASE_URL/admin/settings -u $USER:$PASSWORD \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"completed": {"client": "172.1.2.3", "tag": "both_user_and_error"}}'
----

You cannot add a new instance of an existing qualifier to a tagged set using a plus sign (`+`) before the qualifier name.
For example, you cannot add a `user` qualifier to a tagged set that already contains a `user` qualifier.
If you need to track two users with the same error, create two tagged sets, one per user.

You can remove a qualifier from a tagged set using a minus sign (`-`) before the qualifier name, e.g. `-user`.
When you remove the last qualifier from a tagged set, the tagged set is removed.

[NOTE]
--
You can specify multiple tagged sets.
In this case, completed requests are logged if they match all of the qualifiers in any of the tagged sets.

You can also specify a mixture of tagged sets and individual qualifiers.
In this case, completed requests are logged if they match any of the individual qualifiers, or all of the qualifiers in any of the tagged sets.
--

=== Completed Threshold

The [.param]`completed-threshold` field provides another way of specifying the `threshold` qualifier within the `completed` field.

This field sets the minimum request duration after which requests are added to the `system:completed_requests` catalog.
The default value is 1000ms.
Specify [.in]`0` to log all requests and [.in]`-1` to not log any requests to the keyspace.

To specify a different value, use:

[source,sh]
----
curl $BASE_URL/admin/settings -u $USER:$PASSWORD \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"completed-threshold":0}'
----

=== Completed Limit

The [.param]`completed-limit` field sets the number of most recent requests to be tracked in the `system:completed_requests` catalog.
The default value is 4000.
Specify [.in]`0` to not track any requests and [.in]`-1` to set no limit.

To specify a different value, use:

[source,sh]
----
curl $BASE_URL/admin/settings -u $USER:$PASSWORD \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"completed-limit":1000}'

[#query-monitoring-settings]
== Query Profiling

Query profiling enables you to obtain more detailed monitoring information and finer execution timings for any query.
You can set query profiling to the following levels:

* `off` -- query profiling is disabled.
* `phases` -- query profiling is enabled, including information about the phases of query execution.
* `timings` -- query profiling is enabled, including information about the phases of query execution, and detailed timing information.

You can set query profiling in the following ways:

* At the <<enable-settings-for-a-query-engine,node level>>, so that it is enabled for all queries on that node.
* At the <<enable-settings-per-session-or-per-query,request level>>, for individual queries.

For more information about Query settings and parameters, see xref:n1ql:n1ql-manage/query-settings.adoc[].

[#enable-settings-for-a-query-engine]

[[plan]]
=== Profiling Details in System Catalogs

The <<sys-active-req,system:active_requests>> and <<sys-completed-req,system:completed_requests>> system catalogs always return profiling information regarding query phases: that is, phase times, phase counts, and phase operators.

The <<sys-active-req,system:active_requests>>, <<sys-completed-req,system:completed_requests>>, and <<sys-prepared,system:prepareds>> system catalogs also support the `meta().plan` virtual attribute.
This captures the whole query plan, and includes profiling information regarding execution timings.

To get execution timing information from these system catalogs, you must explicitly specify `meta().plan` in the projection list for the SELECT query.

Within these system catalogs, not all statements have a `meta().plan` attribute.

* With <<sys-active-req,system:active_requests>> and <<sys-completed-req,system:completed_requests>>, the `meta().plan` attribute is only available for statements that you run when profile is set to `timings`.

* With <<sys-prepared,system:prepareds>>, the `meta().plan` attribute is available for all statements.

[NOTE]
====
When request profiling is set to `timings`, profiling information is likely to use 100KB+ per entry in the `system:completed_requests` keyspace.

* Due to the added overhead of running both profiling and xref:manage:manage-logging/manage-logging.adoc[logging], turn on both of them only when needed.
Running only one of them continuously has no noticeable affect on performance.
* Profiling does not carry any extra cost beyond memory for completed requests, so it's fine to run it continuously.
