[abstract]
{description}
It is a powerful, developer friendly tool that enables you to query and update data from Couchbase Server.
The cbq shell enables you to perform all the operations that are supported by the Query Workbench and more, such as additional scripting functionality.

include::ROOT:partial$component-signpost.adoc[]

The cbq shell executable, [.cmd]`cbq`, is available in the Couchbase Server installation directory.
It is also available in the xref:cli:cli-intro.adoc#server-tools-packages[Couchbase Server tools] package beginning with version 7.6.2.

== Examples on this Page

The examples on this page use the `travel-sample` dataset, which is supplied with Couchbase Server.
For instructions on how to install the sample data, see xref:server:manage:manage-settings/install-sample-buckets.adoc[Sample Buckets].

=== Executing a Single Command

When you start the cbq shell, the cbq shell prompt is displayed.

====
[source,console]
----
cbq>
----
====

The cbq shell interface accepts accepts shell commands as well as {sqlpp} commands.
All the cbq shell commands start with a backslash (`\`).
If the command does not start with a backslash (`\`), the cbq shell interprets the command as a {sqlpp} command.

* To execute a {sqlpp} query at the cbq prompt, type the query.
At the end of the query, type a semicolon `;` and press kbd:[Enter].

* To execute a cbq command at the cbq prompt, type the command name starting with a backslash `\`.
At the end of the command, type a semicolon `;` and press kbd:[Enter].

The cbq shell enables you to manipulate query parameters.
See <<cbq-parameter-manipulation>> for details.

For the complete list of shell commands, see <<table_htk_hgc_fw>>.

=== Support for Multi-line Queries

The cbq shell supports multi-line queries by default, enabling you to enter a query over multiple lines.
When entering a query, you can hit kbd:[Enter] without specifying a semicolon (`;`) at the end of the line to move the cursor to the next line.
The prompt `>` indicates that the shell is in multi-line mode.
For example:

====
[source,console]
----
cbq> SELECT *
   > FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.airline
   > LIMIT 1;
----
====

When you're done, use a semicolon `;` to indicate the end of the query, and then press kbd:[Enter] to execute the query.

=== Handling Comments

You can add comments in your query by preceding the comment with a `&num;` or `--`.
The cbq shell interprets a line that starts with `&num;` or `--` as a comment, logs the line into history, and returns a new prompt.
No other action is taken.

====
[source,sqlpp]
----
SELECT *
#This is the first comment
FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.airline
--This is the second comment
LIMIT 1;
----
====

However, if a comment exists within a statement, it is considered as part of the {sqlpp} command.
If the cbq shell encounters a block comment (enclosed between `/{asterisk}` \... `{asterisk}/`) within a statement, it sends the block comment to the query service.

====
[source,sqlpp]
----
SELECT * FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.airline /* Block comment */ LIMIT 1;
----
====

=== File Based Operations

The cbq shell can execute {sqlpp} and shell commands contained in files using file-based commands and options.
See <<cbq-file-based-ops>> for more information.

=== History

The [.cmd]`cbq` shell stores the history for every session.
All the commands executed in a session are stored in history.
By default, history is stored in `~/.cbq_history`.
You can change the name of the file using the SET command to set the predefined parameter [.var]`histfile`.
See <<cbq-parameter-manipulation>> for more information.

By default, all the commands are stored in the specified file.
You can scroll through history and retrieve the commands from history using the scrolling arrow keys.
Once the query is on the command prompt, you can edit it before executing the updated query.

=== Help

Help displays the help information for the shell commands and for the general usage of cbq.

[tabs]
====
Command Line Option::
+
--
Use the `-h` or `--help` command line option when bringing up the shell to display the information for all available options.

'''

.Example
[source,sh]
----
./cbq -h
----
--

Shell Command::
+
--
Use the [.cmd]`\HELP` shell command during a session to display information for specific shell commands.
If you specify one or more commands, the shell displays the usage information for the specified commands.

If you do not specify a command, the cbq shell lists all the commands for which syntax help is available.

[#cbq-connect-to-cluster]
== Connecting to the Cluster or Query Node

You can connect the cbq shell to Couchbase Server through any of the nodes in the cluster.

[tabs]
====
Command Line Option::
+
--
To establish a connection on startup, use the `-e` or `--engine` command line option, optionally followed by a URL.

'''

.Example
[source,sh]
----
./cbq -e $BASE_URL -u $USER -p $PASSWORD
----

.Result
----
Connected to : http://<HOST>:8091/. Type Ctrl-D or \QUIT to exit.

Path to history file for the shell : ~/.cbq_history
----
--

Shell Command::
+
--
To establish a connection during a session, use the `\CONNECT` shell command, optionally followed by a URL.

'''

.Example
[source,sqlpp]
----
\CONNECT <BASE_URL>;
----

.Result
----
Connected to : http://<HOST>:8091. Type Ctrl-D or \QUIT to exit.
----
--
====

The URL may contain up to three components: the protocol scheme, the host, and a port number.
The URL is optional and if it is not specified, the default URL `+http://localhost:8091+` is used.
An error is thrown if the URL is invalid.

The cbq shell supports the `http://`, `https://`, `couchbase://` and `couchbases://` protocol schemes.
The `https://` and `couchbases://` protocol schemes are encrypted.
For more details, refer to <<cbq-encrypted>>.

The host may be the IP address or hostname of any node in the cluster, as cbq will automatically discover the query nodes.
The cbq shell supports both IPV4 and IPV6 addresses.
For example: `localhost`, `node1`, `127.0.0.1`, or `[fd63:6f75:6368:1075:816:3c1d:789b:bc4]`.

The `couchbase://` and `couchbases://` protocol schemes support the domain name service (DNS).
When using one of these protocol schemes, the host may be a domain name which is resolved using DNS.
For example, this enables you to connect to a cluster or node over the internet.

You may optionally specify the port when using the `http://` or `https://` protocol schemes.
When connecting to the query service, use the query port 8093, or 18093 for an encrypted connection.
When connecting to the cluster, you don't need to specify the port as the connection uses round robin to find a query service to connect to.
If you want to specify a port, use the admin port 8091, or 18091 for an encrypted connection.

You cannot specify the port when using the `couchbase://` or `couchbases://` protocol schemes.

=== Disconnecting

You can close the connection with a node or cluster during the session without exiting the shell using the [.cmd]`\DISCONNECT` command.
If the shell is not connected to any endpoint, an error with a message that the shell is not connected to any instance is thrown.

====
.Example
[source,sqlpp]
----
\DISCONNECT;
----

.Result
----
Couchbase query shell not connected to any endpoint. Use \CONNECT command to connect.
----
====

=== Bringing Up an Unconnected Instance

You can bring up the shell without connecting to any query service or cluster node by using the [.opt]`-ne` or [.opt]`--no-engine` option.
After starting cbq without any connection, you can connect to a node using the [.cmd]`\CONNECT` command.

====
.Example
[source,sh]
----
./cbq -ne
----

.Result
----
Path to history file for the shell : ~/.cbq_history
----
====

=== Exiting the cbq Shell

You can exit the cbq shell by pressing kbd:[Ctrl+D] or by using the `\EXIT` or `\QUIT` command.

The cbq shell first saves the history, closes existing connections, saves the current session in a session file, resets all environment variables, and then closes the shell liner interface.

====
.Example
[source,sqlpp]
----
\EXIT;
----

.Result
[source,console]
----
$
----
====

[#cbq-single-cred]
== Providing Credentials

You can pass a single user name credential to the cbq shell on startup using the `-u` or `--username` command line option, followed by the user name.
The shell then prompts you for a password.

====
.Example
[source,sh]
----
./cbq -e $BASE_URL -u $USER
----

.Result
----
Enter Password:
Connected to : http://<HOST>:8091/. Type Ctrl-D or \QUIT to exit.
----
====

You can also provide a single password credential using the `-p` or `--password` command line option, followed by the password.
You cannot use this option by itself.
It must be used with the `-u` option to specify the user name that the password is associated with.

====
.Example
[source,sh]
----
./cbq --e $BASE_URL -u $USER -p $PASSWORD
----

.Result
----
Connected to : http://<HOST>:8091/. Type Ctrl-D or \QUIT to exit.
----
====

[#accessing-a-secure-keyspace]
=== Providing Credentials in the Connection String

You can pass the username and password by inserting them into the connection string.
This method is not recommended when starting cbq, as you must quote or URL-encode any special characters in the username or password.
However, this method may be useful for specifying the username and password when connecting to the cluster or node within a cbq session.

To pass credentials in the connection string:

. Add the username immediately after the protocol scheme.
. After the username, add a colon `:` followed by the password.
. After the password, add an at sign `@` followed by the rest of the connection string.

[tabs]
====
Command Line Option::
+
--
To pass credentials on startup, use the `-e` or `--engine` command line option, and specify the username and password in the URL.

'''

In this example, `$HOST` and `$PORT` are the parts of the cluster or node URL following the protocol scheme.

.Example
[source,sh]
----
./cbq -engine="http://$USER:$PASSWORD@$HOST:$PORT/"
----
--

Shell Command::
+
--
To pass credentials during a session, use the `\CONNECT` shell command, and specify the username and password in the URL.

'''

In this example, `<HOST>` and `<PORT>` are the parts of the cluster or node URL following the protocol scheme.

.Example
[source,sqlpp]
----
\CONNECT http://<USER>:<PASSWORD>@<HOST>:<PORT>/;
----
--
====

[#cbq-multiple-creds]
=== Providing Multiple Credentials for Authorization

When starting the cbq shell, you can set the credentials using a single command line option, as an alternative to specifying the username and password separately.
This method is not recommended, as you must quote or escape any special characters in the username or password.

You can also use the `\SET` or `\PUSH` shell command to set the credentials query parameter within a session.
This enables you to change credentials before executing a query, for example to switch to a database user with access to another keyspace.
Note that the credentials are set for the remainder of the shell session and not just on a per query basis.

The list of credentials can contain one or multiple credentials.
Each credential consists of an identity and a password separated by a colon `:`.
To specify multiple credentials, append all the user names and passwords to the same credentials array.

[tabs#pass-cred-shell-cmd]
====
Command Line Option::
+
--
To set the credentials on startup, use the `-c` or `--credentials` command line option, followed by the list of credentials.

'''

In this example, `$USER2` and `$PASSWORD2` are alternative credentials with access to a second keyspace.

.Example
[source,sh]
----
./cbq e $BASE_URL -c=$USER:$PASSWORD,$USER2:$PASSWORD2
----
--

Shell Command::
+
--
To change credentials during a session, use the `\SET` shell command to specify the [.param]`-creds` query parameter, followed by the list of credentials.

'''

In this example, `<USER2>` and `<PASSWORD2>` are alternative credentials with access to a second keyspace.

.Example
[source,sqlpp]
----
\SET -creds <USER>:<PASSWORD>, <USER2>:<PASSWORD2>;
----
--
====

For more information about using multiple credentials, see xref:n1ql-rest-query:index.adoc#creds[Query Service REST API] and xref:n1ql:n1ql-rest-api/exauthrequest.adoc[].

=== Displaying the Credentials

You can display the credentials for the current session using the <<cbq-echo,\ECHO>> shell command.
This command displays only the user names (and not the passwords).

====
.Example
[source,sqlpp]
----
\ECHO -creds;
----

.Result
----
<USER>:*
----
====

You can also display a full list of variables using the <<cbq-set,\SET>> command specified without any arguments.

====
.Example
[source,sqlpp]
----
\SET;
----

.Result
----
 Query Parameters : 
 Parameter name : creds
 Value : [ "<USER>:*" ]


 Named Parameters : 

 User Defined Session Parameters : 

 Predefined Session Parameters : 
 Parameter name : histfile
 Value : [".cbq_history"]

 Parameter name : batch
 Value : ["off"]

 Parameter name : quiet
 Value : [false]
----
====

[#cbq-encrypted]
== Using an Encrypted Connection

The cbq shell supports self-signed certificates for encrypting communication between clusters.

You can connect to the cluster or node with an encrypted protocol scheme -- that is, either `https://` or `couchbases://`.
To do this, you can provide the root CA certificate, the chain certificate, and the client key file using the <<opt-cacert,--cacert>>, <<opt-cert,--cert>>, and <<opt-key,--key>> options.
You can use the <<opt-skip-verify,--no-ssl-verify>> option to skip the verification of certificates.

When connecting to a cluster or node with an encrypted protocol scheme, the default ports are 18091 and 18093.
You cannot specify the port when using the `couchbases://` protocol scheme.

For more details, refer to <<cbq-connect-to-cluster>>.

[#cbq-parameter-manipulation]
== Parameter Manipulation

The cbq shell categorizes parameters into the following types:

* Query parameters
* Named parameters
* User-defined session variables
* Pre-defined session variables

=== Parameter Configuration

When using parameters, you can set a stack of values for each parameter.
You can either push a new value onto the stack using the `\PUSH` command, or set the current value for a parameter using the `\SET` command.
The `\SET` command always modifies the top of a variable's stack while the `\PUSH` command adds to the stack.
When you use `\PUSH` with no arguments, it copies the top element of every parameter's stack (except the predefined parameters) and pushes that copy to the top of its respective stack.
As a result, each stack grows by 1, but the values are preserved.
You can then use the `\SET` command to modify the top value.

To unset the values from a parameter's stack, you can use the `\UNSET` command to remove all the values from the stack and delete the corresponding parameter stack.
However, if you want to delete a single value from the settings, use the `\POP` command.
When you use the `\POP` command with no arguments, it pops the one value from the top of each parameter's stack.

To display all the parameters defined in a session, use the `\SET` command with no arguments.

=== Setting Variable Values

To set the value of a parameter, use the `\SET` or `\PUSH` shell command, followed by a parameter name and parameter value.

The parameter name may have a prefix, depending on the type of parameter: query parameter, named parameter, user-defined session variable, or predefined session variable.
The cbq shell uses the prefix to differentiate between the different types of parameters.

.Prefixes for Parameters
[#table_ltk_c5s_5v,cols="2,5"]
|===
| Prefix | Parameter Type

| `-`
| Query parameter

| `-$` or `-@`
| Named parameters

| `$`
| User defined session variable

| No prefix
| Predefined (built-in) session variable
|===

NOTE: Positional parameters are set using the [.param]`-args` query parameter.

For more details about the available query parameters (prefixed by `-`), see xref:n1ql:n1ql-manage/query-settings.adoc#section_nnj_sjk_k1b[Request-Level Parameters].
As a best practice, save the initial set of basic parameters and their default values using the [.cmd]`\PUSH` command (with no arguments).

====
The following example sets the `airport` named parameter, pushes two positional parameters to the `args` query parameter stack, and then displays all parameters.

.Example
[source,sqlpp]
----
\SET -$airport "SJC";
\PUSH -args ["LAX", 6];
\SET;
----

.Result
----
Query Parameters ::
Parameter name : args Value  [["LAX",6]]

Named Parameters ::
Parameter name : airport Value  ["SJC"]

User Defined Session Parameters ::

Predefined Session Parameters ::
Parameter name : histfile Value  [".cbq_history"]
----

The following example pushes a new value to the `airport` named parameter stack, duplicates the top value in each stack except the predefined session parameters, and then displays all parameters.

.Example
[source,sqlpp]
----
\PUSH -$airport "SFO";
\PUSH;
\SET;
----

.Result
----
Query Parameters ::
Parameter name : args Value  [["LAX",6] ["LAX",6]]

Named Parameters ::
Parameter name : airport Value  ["SJC" "SFO" "SFO"]

User Defined Session Parameters ::

Predefined Session Parameters ::
Parameter name : histfile Value  [".cbq_history"]
----

The following example sets the top level of the `airport` named parameter stack to a new value, and then displays all parameters.

.Example
[source,sqlpp]
----
\SET -args ["SFO", 8];
\SET;
----

.Result
----
Query Parameters ::
Parameter name : args Value  [["LAX",6] ["SFO",8]]

Named Parameters ::
Parameter name : airport Value  ["SJC" "SFO" "SFO"]

User Defined Session Parameters ::

Predefined Session Parameters ::
Parameter name : histfile Value  [".cbq_history"]
----
====

=== Handling Named Parameters

To define named parameters, use the `\SET` or `\PUSH` command.
For each named parameter, prefix the variable name with `-$` or `-@`.

For more details about named parameters, see xref:n1ql:n1ql-manage/query-settings.adoc#section_srh_tlm_n1b[Named Parameters and Positional Parameters].

====
The following example creates named parameters `r` and `date` with values `9.5` and `"1-1-2016"` respectively.

.Example
[source,sqlpp]
----
\SET -$r 9.5;
\SET -@date "1-1-2016";
----
====

=== Handling Positional Parameters

To define positional parameters, use the `\SET` or `\PUSH` command with the [.param]`-args` query parameter, followed by an array containing the different values that correspond to positions within the query.

For more details about positional parameters, see xref:n1ql:n1ql-manage/query-settings.adoc#section_srh_tlm_n1b[Named Parameters and Positional Parameters].

====
.Example
[source,sqlpp]
----
\SET -args [ 9.5, "1-1-2016"];
----
====

=== Handling Predefined Session Variables

The following table lists the available predefined session variables.

.Predefined Session Variables
[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
| Variable Name | Possible Values | Description

| `histfile`
| Valid file name
| Specifies the file name to store the command history.
By default the file is saved in the user's home directory.

Default: `.cbq_history`

| `batch`
| String (`"on"`, `"off"`)
| This variable is available only with the Analytics Service.
When specified, cbq sends the queries to Analytics only when you hit EOF or \ to indicate the end of the batch input.

Default: `"off"`

| `quiet`
| Boolean
| When specified, disables the startup connection message for the cbq shell.

Default: `false`
|===

=== Resetting Variable Values

You can reset the value of a variable by either popping it or deleting it altogether.

To pop the top of every parameter's stack once, use the `\POP` command without any arguments.

====
.Example
[source,sqlpp]
----
\POP;
\SET;
----

.Result
----
Query Parameters ::
Parameter name : args Value  [["LAX",6]]

Named Parameters ::
Parameter name : airport Value  ["SJC" "SFO"]

User Defined Session Parameters ::

Predefined Session Parameters ::
Parameter name : histfile Value  [".cbq_history"]
----
====

To pop the top value from a single parameter's stack, use the `\POP` command, followed by the parameter prefix and parameter name.

====
.Example
[source,sqlpp]
----
\POP -$airport;
\SET;
----

.Result
----
Query Parameters ::
Parameter name : args Value  [["LAX",6]]

Named Parameters ::
Parameter name : airport Value  ["SJC"]

User Defined Session Parameters ::

Predefined Session Parameters ::
Parameter name : histfile Value  [".cbq_history"]
----
====

To pop all the values of a parameter's stack and then delete the parameter, use the `\UNSET` command, followed by the parameter prefix and parameter name.

====
.Example
[source,sqlpp]
----
\UNSET -$airport;
\SET;
----

.Result
----
Query Parameters ::
Parameter name : args Value  [["LAX",6]]

Named Parameters ::

User Defined Session Parameters ::

Predefined Session Parameters ::
Parameter name : histfile Value  [".cbq_history"]
----
====

[#cbq-shell-cmd-echo]
== Using ECHO to Display Values of Parameters and More

The ECHO command displays the current values of the parameters set for a session.
You can use it to display any input string or command aliases that have been created using the ALIAS shell command.

=== Echo a String or Statement

To echo a string or a {sqlpp} statement, use the `\ECHO` command, followed by the string or statement.

====
.Example
[source,sqlpp]
----
\ECHO hello;

[source,sqlpp]
----
SELECT * FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.airline LIMIT 1;
----
====

=== Echo a Parameter

To echo a parameter, use the `\ECHO` command, followed by the parameter prefix and parameter name.

If you do not include the parameter prefix, the shell considers the parameter as a generic statement and displays the parameter as is.

====
.Example
[source,sqlpp]
----
\ECHO -$r;
----

.Result
----
9.5
----
====

[#cbq-shell-cmd-alias]

[#cbq-prepared-stmts]
== Executing Prepared Statements

You can use the shell command to execute prepared statements.
As a pre-requisite, you must first prepare a statement.
To prepare and execute a statement, follow these steps:

== Canceling a Query

You can cancel a running query by using the kbd:[Ctrl+C] keys.

=== Connection Timeout Parameter

You can use the timeout parameter to limit the running time of a query.
This parameter specifies the time to wait before returning an error when executing a query.

Timeout can be specified in the following units: `ns` for nanoseconds, `μs` for microseconds, `ms` for milliseconds, `s` for seconds, `m` for minutes, and `h` for hours.
Examples of valid values include `"0.5s"`, `"10ms"`, or `"1m"`.
An error is thrown if the timeout is invalid.

=== Redirecting Results to a File

You can redirect all the output for a session or part of a session to a specified output file.
If the file doesn't exist, it is created.
If the file already exists, it is overwritten.

[tabs]
====
Command Line Option::
+
--
Use the `-o` or `--output` command line option, followed by the output file.

'''

.Example
[source,sh]
----
./cbq -e $BASE_URL -u $USER -p $PASSWORD -o temp_output.txt
----
--

Shell Command::
+
--
To start redirecting commands during a session, use `\REDIRECT` followed by the output file.
To stop redirecting commands, use `\REDIRECT OFF`.
All the commands specified after `\REDIRECT` and before `\REDIRECT OFF` are saved into the specified output file.

You can specify multiple `\REDIRECT` commands.
When you do so, the output file changes to the specified files and switches back to [.out]`stdout` only when you specify `\REDIRECT OFF`.

You can append redirected output to an existing file using <<file-append-mode>>.

'''

.Example
[source,sqlpp]
----
\REDIRECT temp_output.txt;
CREATE PRIMARY INDEX ON `travel-sample`.inventory.airline USING GSI;
SELECT * FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.airline LIMIT 1;
\HELP;
\REDIRECT OFF;
----
--
====

[[file-append-mode]]
=== File Append Mode

You can use file append mode to specify that cbq should append redirected output to the end of an existing file, rather than overwriting the existing file.

Note that file append mode is only available with the `\REDIRECT` command within a shell session.
It is not available for the `-o` or `--output` command line option.
When you use the `-o` or `--output` command line option, the specified output file is always overwritten.

To use file append mode, include a plus sign `+` at the start of the output path or filename.

====
.Example
[source,sqlpp]
----
\REDIRECT +temp_output.txt;
SELECT * FROM `travel-sample`.inventory.airline LIMIT 1;
\REDIRECT OFF;
----

Every time you start appending to the output file, a timestamp is added to the end of the output file, followed by any redirected commands and results.

----
-- <2021-07-30T14:48:43.661+01:00> : opened in append mode

[#cbq-server-shell-info]
== Server and Shell Information

The cbq shell provides commands that convey information about the shell or cluster endpoints.

=== Version

You can find the version of the client (shell) by using either the command line option to display the current version of the shell and exit, or as a shell command to print the version of the shell during the shell session.

To display the version of the query service, use the xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/metafun.adoc#version[VERSION()] function in {sqlpp}.

[tabs]

=== Exit On Error

When you specify the argument `--exit-on-error`, the cbq shell checks the result returned after executing the query for any error and exits when the first error is encountered.

=== Exit Status

The cbq shell returns the exit status 0 for successful exit with no errors and 1 if an error was encountered before exiting.

== Available Command Line Options and Shell Commands

NOTE: The <<table_a3h_rhz_dw,command line options>> are case sensitive.
