// Remove after the 7.6 versions. 
NOTE: In Couchbase Server versions 7.6.0 and 7.6.1, when you enabled file-based rebalance you could not use this option to choose which Index Service nodes would contain the index.
Couchbase Server 7.6.2 and later have removed this restriction.
See xref:learn:clusters-and-availability/rebalance.adoc#index-rebalance-methods[Index Rebalance Methods].
