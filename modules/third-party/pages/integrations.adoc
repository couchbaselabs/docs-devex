:description: Integrate Couchbase with your development ecosystem and production and deployment tools.


[abstract]
{description}

Third-party and community products and integrations -- 
although not by and large supported by Couchbase (see <<#support-model,Support Model section>>) --
are a vital tool for most larger development projects.

These are examples of integrations that Couchbase or partners have developed to enhance Couchbase, Capella, and partner services.

=== Other Shells

Some languages, such as Ruby, come with REPLs (interactive shells) as standard -- as is normal with many programming languages.
Others have them available as _Notebooks_, such as Python, with https://jupyter.org/[Jupyter Notebook] (which works with _several_ different languages), through which you can interactively develop functionality for a Couchbase app, or blend with analytic tools and charts.



[big-data-connectors]
== Big Data Connectors


Couchbase develops and supports connectors for:

* Elasticsearch and OpenSearch
* The Kafka Connect Framework
* Apache Spark Data Processing Platform
* The Tableau interactive data visualization platform

Couchbase ODBC and JDBC drivers enable any application based on the ODBC/JDBC standards, for example Microsoft Excel, QlikView, or SAP Lumira, as well as Tableau, to connect to a Couchbase Server or cluster.

[#sdk-language-ecosystem]
== SDK Language Ecosystem

Couchbase has SDKs in ten popular languages --
xref:c-sdk:hello-world:overview.adoc[C], 
xref:dotnet-sdk:hello-world:overview.adoc[C# (.NET)], 
xref:go-sdk:hello-world:overview.adoc[Go], 
xref:java-sdk:hello-world:overview.adoc[Java], 
xref:kotlin-sdk:hello-world:overview.adoc[Kotlin], 
xref:nodejs-sdk:hello-world:overview.adoc[Node.js], 
xref:php-sdk:hello-world:overview.adoc[PHP], 
xref:python-sdk:hello-world:overview.adoc[Python], 
xref:ruby-sdk:hello-world:overview.adoc[Ruby], and 
xref:scala-sdk:hello-world:overview.adoc[Scala].

If you develop in one of these languages, you may be interested in (or already using) other libraries in that language's ecosystem, and wondering if it will integrate with Couchbase.

There are too many third party integrations to evaluate and list (and absence of a mention in these pages is no judgement on importance or quality), but the following are well worth investigating:

While Couchbase can't evaluate and list every possible third-party integration, we've provided a list of some you might consider in the sections below.
