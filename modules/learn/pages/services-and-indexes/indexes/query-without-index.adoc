== Sequential Scans

If a keyspace does not have any suitable primary or secondary indexes for a query, the Query service can fall back on a sequential scan of the data to retrieve the document keys.
A sequential scan uses an underlying mechanism known as a K/V range scan.

Sequential scans are intended for simple, ready access to data, and are not intended as a high performance solution.

Sequential scans are best suited to small collections where key order is unimportant, or where the overhead of maintaining an index can't be justified.
For larger collections and greater performance, define the appropriate indexes to speed up your queries.
For ordered document key operations, a primary index provides the same functionality, and will outperform a sequential scan.

NOTE: Sequential scans are unavailable on Memory Only buckets.

== Use Sequential Scans

To query an index using sequential scan, run the query as usual.

If there is a primary index or any suitable secondary index available for the keyspace, the Query service uses that in preference to sequential scan.

=== Prerequisites

[discrete]
===== RBAC Privileges

Users must have the *Query Use Sequential Scans* role on the keyspace to be able to execute a request with a sequential scan.
For more details about user roles, see
{authorization-overview}[].

=== Examples

To try the examples in this section, set the query context to the `tenant_agent_01` scope in the travel sample dataset.
For more information, see xref:n1ql:n1ql-intro/queriesandresults.adoc#query-context[Query Context].

.Check that a collection has no indexes
====
.Query
[source,sqlpp]
----
SELECT * FROM system:indexes
WHERE scope_id = "tenant_agent_01"
  AND keyspace_id = "users";
----

.Result
[source,json]
----
{
  "results": []
}
----

You should see that collection has no primary or secondary indexes.
====

.Run a query without indexes
====
.Query
[source,sqlpp]
----
SELECT name FROM users;
----

.Result
[source,json]
----
[
  {
    "name": "Haley Rohan"
  },
  {
    "name": "Johnnie Lind"
  },
  {
    "name": "Verdie Jaskolski"

  },
  {
    "name": "Destini Turcotte"
  },
  {
    "name": "Sienna Cummerata"
  }
]
----

The query returns 11 documents.
Notice that the query takes one or more seconds.

.Check explain plan for query without index

              {

                ]
              }

        }
      ]
    },
    "text": "SELECT name FROM users;"
  }
]
----

The explain plan includes a primary scan operator, using `sequentialscan` rather than `gsi`.

The explain plan reports that the primary scan operator uses an index called `#sequentialscan`.
This name is a placeholder -- in reality there is no index.
====

== Monitor Sequential Scans

You can monitor sequential scans using the `system:completed_requests` catalog.

* Completed requests which used sequential scan include a `primaryScan.Seq` property within the request's `phaseCounts`, `phaseOperators`, and `phaseTimes`, in addition to the `primaryScan` property.

* In contrast, queries which used a primary index include a `primaryScan.GSI` property within the request's `phaseCounts`, `phaseOperators`, and `phaseTimes`, in addition to the `primaryScan` property.

The `system:completed_requests` catalog also includes a `~qualifier` field, which indicates the reason why any request was captured.
A completed requests qualifier automatically captures any requests where more than 10000 keys have been returned by sequential scans.
In most cases, this indicates that you should create an index to support the request.

Statistics on sequential scan usage are also available in request profiling information.

For more details, see xref:n1ql:n1ql-manage/monitoring-n1ql-query.adoc[].

=== Examples

.Get completed requests which used sequential scan
====
.Query
[source,sqlpp]
----
SELECT * FROM system:completed_requests
WHERE phaseCounts.`primaryScan.Seq` IS NOT MISSING;
----

You must wrap the property name `primaryScan.Seq` in backquotes, because the property name contains a period.
The period after `phaseCounts` is a separator between nested property names, whereas the period within `primaryScan.Seq` is actually part of the property name.

== Manage Sequential Scans

For a xref:billing:billing.adoc#free-tier-plan[free operational cluster], sequential scan is available in the Query tab, and via cluster access credentials in the SDKs or Couchbase Shell.

For xref:billing:billing.adoc#paid-plan[paid service plans], sequential scan is not available by default.
To enable sequential scan, please xref:support:manage-support.adoc[contact support].
