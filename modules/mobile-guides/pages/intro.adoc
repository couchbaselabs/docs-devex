Couchbase Mobile consists of Couchbase Lite -- an embedded, offline-first database for edge devices -- synced peer-to-peer, or synchronized to your Couchbase Cluster via App Services
(or Sync Gateway, if you're using self-managed Couchbase Server instead of Capella).

For the easiest way to start building mobile apps with Couchbase,
follow the steps to xref:cloud:get-started:configuring-app-services.adoc[set up an App Services trial], creating your endpoint, and getting your connection string.
Then head to the getting started section of your chosen platform in the xref:couchbase-lite::introduction.adoc[Couchbase Lite Docs].
