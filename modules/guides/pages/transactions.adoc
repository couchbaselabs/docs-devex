== Introduction

Couchbase transactions enable you to carry out ACID (atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable) actions on the database.
This how-to guide covers {sqlpp} support for Couchbase transactions.
Some SDKs also support Couchbase transactions.
Refer to <<related-links>> for further details.

Only DML (data modification language) statements are permitted within a transaction:

[[settings]]
== Transaction Parameters
:lead: The following example shows transaction parameters for the examples on this page.

You can specify various settings and parameters to control how transactions work.
You can access transaction settings and parameters through any of the usual Query tools, such as the Query tab or the cbq shell.

[tabs]
====
Query Tab::
+
--
To specify parameters for a Couchbase transaction, use the Query Options dialog.

. To display the Query Options dialog, click btn:[Query Options].

. To specify the transaction scan consistency, in the *Scan Consistency* list, select an option.

. To specify the transaction timeout, in the *Transaction Timeout* box, enter a value in seconds.

. To specify any other transaction parameters, click the btn:[+] button in the *Named Parameters* section.
When the new named parameter appears, enter the name in the *name* box and a value in the *value* box.

. To save your preferences and return to the Query tab, click btn:[Save].

'''

image::transactions-preferences.png['The Query Options dialog, with Scan Consistency set to "not_bounded", Transaction Timeout set to "120", and named parameter "durability_level" set to "none"']

* The transaction scan consistency is set to `not_bounded`.
* The durability level of all the mutations within the transaction is set to `"none"`.
* The transaction timeout is set to `120`.

CBQ Shell::
+
--
To specify parameters for a Couchbase transaction, use the `\SET` command.

[[single-statement]]
== Single Statement Transactions

You can create a Couchbase transaction containing a single DML statement.

[tabs]
====
////
Query Tab::
+
--
To execute a single statement as a transaction, simply enter the statement in the Query Editor and click btn:[Run as TX].

----
include::n1ql:example$transactions/single.n1ql[tag=query]

CBQ Shell::

To execute a single statement as a transaction, set the `tximplicit` parameter to `true`.

[[multiple-statement]]
== Multiple Statement Transactions
:lead: For a worked example showing a complete transaction using {sqlpp}, see xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/transactions.adoc#worked-example[Transaction Worked Example]. \
Individual {sqlpp} transaction statements are described in the sections below.

A Couchbase transaction may contain multiple DML statements.
In this case, you must use {sqlpp} transaction statements to support the transaction:

* <<begin,BEGIN TRANSACTION>> to start the transaction.
* <<set,SET TRANSACTION>> to specify transaction settings.
* <<savepoint,SAVEPOINT>> to set a transaction savepoint.
* <<rollback,ROLLBACK TRANSACTION>> to roll back a transaction.
* <<commit,COMMIT TRANSACTION>> to commit a transaction.

[tabs]
====
Query Tab::
+
--
To execute a transaction containing multiple statements:

. Compose the sequence of statements in the Query Editor.
Each statement must be terminated with a semicolon.

. After each statement, press kbd:[Shift+Enter] to start a new line _without_ executing the query.

. When you have entered the entire transaction, click btn:[Run] to execute the transaction.

'''

{lead}
--

CBQ Shell::
+
--
To execute a transaction containing multiple statements, create the transaction one statement at a time.

Once you have started a transaction, all statements within the cbq shell session are assumed to be part of the same transaction until you rollback or commit the transaction.

NOTE: You must be using cbq shell version 2.0 or above to use the automatic transaction ID functionality.

[[begin]]
=== Begin a Transaction

To start a transaction, use the `BEGIN TRANSACTION` statement.

====
The following statement begins a transaction.

[source,sqlpp]
----
include::n1ql:example$transactions/multiple.n1ql[tag=begin]
----

{github}

.Result
[source,json,indent=0]
----
include::n1ql:example$transactions/results.jsonc[tag=begin]
----

<.> Beginning a transaction returns the transaction ID.
====

For further details, refer to xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/begin-transaction.adoc[BEGIN TRANSACTION].

[[set]]
=== Specify Transaction Settings

To specify transaction settings, use the `SET TRANSACTION` statement.

NOTE: Currently, the only available transaction setting is "isolation level read committed".
This setting is enabled by default.
The `SET TRANSACTION` statement is therefore optional and may be omitted.

====
The following statement specifies transaction settings.

[source,sqlpp]
----
include::n1ql:example$transactions/multiple.n1ql[tag=set]
----

{github}
====

For further details, refer to xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/set-transaction.adoc[SET TRANSACTION].

[[savepoint]]
=== Set a Savepoint

To set a savepoint within a transaction, use the `SAVEPOINT` statement and specify a name for the savepoint.

====
The following statement sets a savepoint.

[source,sqlpp]
----
include::n1ql:example$transactions/multiple.n1ql[tag=savepoint-1]
----

{github}
====

For further details, refer to xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/savepoint.adoc[SAVEPOINT].

[[rollback]]
=== Roll Back a Transaction

To roll back a transaction, use the `ROLLBACK TRANSACTION` statement.

By default, this statement rolls back the entire transaction.
If you want to roll back to a savepoint, use the `TO SAVEPOINT` keywords and specify the savepoint name.

====
The following statement rolls back a transaction to a specified savepoint.

[source,sqlpp]
----
include::n1ql:example$transactions/multiple.n1ql[tag=rollback]
----

{github}
====

For further details, refer to xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/rollback-transaction.adoc[ROLLBACK TRANSACTION].

[[commit]]
=== Commit a Transaction

To commit a transaction, use the `COMMIT TRANSACTION` statement.

====
The following statement commits a transaction.

[source,sqlpp]
----
include::n1ql:example$transactions/multiple.n1ql[tag=commit]
----

{github}
====

For further details, refer to xref:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/commit-transaction.adoc[COMMIT TRANSACTION].
