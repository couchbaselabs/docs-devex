{description}
The {sqlpp} query language enables you to retrieve a document by inspecting its contents to see if it matches a certain criterion.
Key-value operations are quicker, but querying documents allows for richer search capabilities -- for example, "Give me all likes and followed users located in the US", versus "Give me a user with the ID e3d882a4".
