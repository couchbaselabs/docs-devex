== Introduction

Every item in a database goes through the basic _CRUD_ cycle, which is typical of an application's use of data.
CRUD stands for create, read, update, and delete:

* **C**reate: when data is first inserted into the cluster
* **R**ead: when an application retrieves the data
* **U**pdate: when data is modified to reflect a change in the state represented by the data
* **D**elete: when the data is no longer needed

The xref:learn:services-and-indexes/services/data-service.adoc[Key-Value (KV) or Data Service] offers Couchbase clients the fastest and simplest way to create, retrieve or mutate data where the key is known.
