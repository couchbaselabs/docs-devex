:page-topic-type: guide 
:description: You can use the REST API and a curl command to run a search against a Vector Search index and return similar vectors from a Couchbase Capella database.

{description}

== Prerequisites 

* You have the Search Service enabled on a node in your database.
For more information about how to change Services on your database, see xref:cloud:clusters:modify-database.adoc[].

* Your user account has the *Search Admin* or *Search Reader* role. 

* You have installed the Couchbase command-line tool (CLI).

* You have the hostname for your database.
+
For more information about how to find the hostname for your Capella database, see xref:clouds:get-capella-host-name.adoc[].

* You have created a Vector Search index. 
+
For more information about how to create a Vector Search index, see xref:create-vector-search-index-ui.adoc[] or xref:create-vector-search-index-rest-api.adoc[].

== Procedure 

To run a Vector search with the REST API: 

. In your command-line tool, enter a `curl` command with the `XPOST` verb. 
. Set your header content to include `Content-Type: application/json`.
. Enter your username, password, and the Search Service endpoint on port `8094` with the name of the Vector Search index you want to query:

[source,console]
----
include::example$run-vector-search-header.sh[]
----
+
To use SSL, use the `https` protocol in the Search Service endpoint URL and port `18094`. 
. Enter the JSON payload for your query. 
+
TIP: You can copy the JSON for a Query Request from the Capella UI to use in your REST API call.
For more information about how to perform a search with the UI, see xref:search:simple-search-ui.adoc[].

+
In the following example, the JSON payload uses a hybrid Vector Search and Search query on an index named `color-index`. 
The query searches for a specified normalized color vector, but uses the regular query parameters to limit the brightness of the returned color to the range of `70-80`:

== Next Steps 

If you do not get the search results you were expecting, you can change the JSON definition xref:search:search-index-params.adoc[for your Search index] or change the parameters xref:search:search-request-params.adoc[for your Search query].
