:page-topic-type: guide 
:description: You can use the REST API and a curl command to run a search against a Vector Search index and return similar vectors.

{description}

== Prerequisites 

* You have the Search Service enabled on a node in your database. 

* Your user account has the *Search Admin* or *Search Reader* role. 

* You installed the Couchbase command-line tool (CLI).

* You have the hostname or IP address for your database. 

* You have created a Vector Search index. 
+
For more information about how to create a Vector Search index, see xref:create-vector-search-index-ui.adoc[] or xref:create-vector-search-index-rest-api.adoc[].

== Procedure 

To run a Vector search with the REST API: 

. In your command-line tool, enter a `curl` command with the `XPOST` verb. 
. Set your header content to include `"Content-Type: application/json"`.
. Enter your username, password, and the Search Service endpoint on port `8094` with the name of the Vector Search index you want to query:

[source,console]
----
include::example$run-vector-search-header.sh[]
----
+
To use SSL, use the `https` protocol in the Search Service endpoint URL and port `18094`. 
. Enter the JSON payload for your query. 
+
TIP: You can copy the JSON for a Query Request from the Couchbase Server Web Console to use in your REST API call.
For more information about how to perform a search with the UI, see xref:search:simple-search-ui.adoc[].

=== Example

In the following example, the JSON payload uses both a `query` and `knn` object to run both a Vector Search and traditional Search query on an index named `color-index`.

The query searches for a specified Euclidean distance color vector, but uses the `query` object to search for a color with a `brightness` value in the range of `70-80`:

[source,console]
----
include::example$run-vector-search-payload.sh[]
----

The Search Service combines the Vector search results from the `knn` object with the traditional `query` object by using an `OR` function. 
If the same documents match the `knn` and `query` objects, the Search Service ranks those documents higher in search results.  

For more information about the available properties for a Search query JSON payload, see xref:search:search-request-params.adoc[].

== Next Steps 

If you do not get the search results you were expecting, you can change the JSON definition xref:search:search-index-params.adoc[for your Search index] or change the parameters xref:search:search-request-params.adoc[for your Search query].
