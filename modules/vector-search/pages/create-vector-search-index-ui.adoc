:description: You can create a Vector Search index with the Couchbase Server Web Console. 

[abstract]
{description}

You must create a Vector Search index before you can xref:run-vector-search-ui.adoc[run a search] that supports vector comparisons.

TIP: Vector Search indexes can include all the same features and settings as a Search index. 
For more information about Search indexes, see the xref:search:search.adoc[Search documentation].

== Prerequisites

* You have deployed the Search Service on a node in your database. 

* You have a bucket with scopes and collections in your database. 

* You have documents in a keyspace inside that bucket that contain vector embeddings. 

* Your user account has the *Search Admin* role for the bucket where you want to create the index.  

* You have logged in to the Couchbase Server Web Console. 

== Procedure 

To create a Vector Search index with the Couchbase Server Web Console: 

. Go to *Search*.
. Click btn:[Add Index].
. In the *Index Name* field, enter a name for the Vector Search index. 
+
[NOTE]
====
Your index name must start with an alphabetic character (a-z or A-Z). It can only contain alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, or 0-9), hyphens (-), or underscores (_).

For Couchbase Server version 7.6 and later, your index name must be unique inside your selected bucket and scope. You cannot have 2 indexes with the same name inside the same bucket and scope.
====

. In the *Bucket* list, select the bucket that contains the documents you want to include in your index. 
. Expand *Customize Index*. 
. Select *Use non-default scope/collection(s)*.
.. In the *Scope* list, select the scope that contains the documents you want to include in your index.
. Expand *Mappings* and xref:create-type-mapping.adoc[create a new type mapping on a collection]:
.. Click btn:[Add Type Mapping].
.. In the *Collection* list, select the collection that contains the documents you want to include in your index. 
.. Select *Only index specified fields*. 
.. Click btn:[OK].
. xref:search:create-child-field.adoc[] on the new collection type mapping with the following settings: 
.. In the *Field* field, enter the name of the field in your documents that contains your vector embeddings.
+
Vectors must be represented as an array of floating point numbers. 
.. In the *Type* list, select *vector*. 
.. In the *Dimension* field, enter the total number of elements in the array that holds the vector embeddings for your documents.
+ 
The Search Service supports arrays up to 2048 elements. 
.. In the *Similarity metric* list, select the method to use to calculate the similarity between search term and Search index vectors.
+ 
For more information, see xref:search:child-field-options-reference.adoc[].
.. In the *Optimized for* list, select whether the Search Service should optimize Search queries for accuracy (*recall*) or speed (*latency*).
+
For more information, see xref:search:child-field-options-reference.adoc[].
.. Select *Index*.
.. Click btn:[OK].
. (Optional) xref:search:create-child-field.adoc[Create another child field] on the new collection type mapping for any additional fields you want to return in your search results.
. Click btn:[Create Index].

== Next Steps 

This basic Vector Search index includes the vector embeddings from the field you specified in your type mapping.
If you chose to add additional child fields, the Search Service can also return data from those fields when you run a Vector Search query. 

You can customize your Vector Search index like any other Search index to add additional data and improve search results.
