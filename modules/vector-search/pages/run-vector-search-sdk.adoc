== Example: Searching for a Similar Color Vector

The sample dataset inside `rgb.json` has small embedding vectors inside the `colorvect_l2` field. 
These embedding vectors describe a color using RGB values. 
For example, the color red has an embedding vector of `[255, 0, 0]`. 

The following example code searches for the color navy (`[0.0, 0.0, 128.0]`) in the `rgb.json` dataset:

== Example: Semantic Search with Color Descriptions

[NOTE]
====
The following code sample requires you to have a paid subscription to the OpenAI API to generate an embedding vector from a sample text string.
For more information about pricing for the OpenAI API, see https://openai.com/pricing[OpenAI's Pricing page^] for embedding models.

The `rgb.json` sample data contains ready-made embedding vectors for each color's `description` text.
For an example of how to use a ready-made vector with Vector Search, see xref:run-vector-search-ui.adoc[].

If you use the sample dataset inside `rgb.json`, you can use the OpenAI API to generate an embedding from any text string. 

The following code generates an embedding vector with the question `What color hides everything like the night?`:

== Next Steps

You can xref:search:create-child-field.adoc[create a child field] or xref:search:create-quick-index.adoc[use the Quick Mode editor] to update your Vector Search index to include the `description` field with your search results.

For example, you could use the following JSON Vector Search index payload to create your Search index.
It includes two child field mappings, `colorvect_l2` and `embedding_vector_dot` on two different vector fields in the keyspace's documents.
It also adds 3 normal Search index fields (`brightness`, `color`, and `description`) to add more usable data to the Vector Search index:

[source,json]

include::example$vector-search-index-payload.jsonc[]

Run the example in <<semantic,>> again to see the `description` paragraphs in your results.

Vector Search indexes can use the same settings and features as regular Search indexes.
If you want to add additional fields and features to your index, see xref:search:customize-index.adoc[].
