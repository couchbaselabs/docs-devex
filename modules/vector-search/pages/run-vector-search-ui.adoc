For more information about how the Search Service scores documents in search results, see xref:run-searches.adoc#scoring[Scoring for Search Queries].

== Prerequisites 

* You have the Search Service enabled on a node in your database.
For more information about how to change Services on your database, see xref:cloud:clusters:modify-database.adoc[].

* You have created a Vector Search index.

For the best results, consider using the sample Vector Search index from xref:create-vector-search-index-ui.adoc#example[Create a Vector Search Index in Quick Mode].

* You have logged in to the Couchbase {page-ui-name}. 

== Procedure 

To run a Vector Search with the {page-ui-name}: 

. On the *Databases* page, select the database where you created your Search index. 
. Go to menu:Data Tools[Search]. 
. Next to your Vector Search index, click btn:[Search].
. In the *Search* field, enter a search query.
. Press kbd:[Enter] or click btn:[Search].
. . (Optional) To view a document and its source collection, click a document name in the search results list. 

[#similarity]
=== Example: Running a Simple Vector Similarity Query

For example, the following query searches for the top 2 vectors similar to the vector `[ 0, 0, 128 ]` in the `colorvect_l2` field:

[source,json]
----
include::example$run-vector-search-payload-ui.jsonc[]
----

By using the special `match_none` query in the `query` field, the Search query is only a Vector Search query.
It only returns the `k` number of similar vectors.

The Search Service combines the Vector search results from a `knn` object with the traditional `query` object by using an `OR` function. 
If the same documents match the `knn` and `query` objects, the Search Service ranks those documents higher in search results.

The document for the color `navy` should be the first result, followed by a similar color. 

[#hybrid]
=== Example: Run a Simple Hybrid Search Query 

The following hybrid Search query searches for the top vector similar to the vector `[ 0, 0, 128 ]` in the `colorvect_l2` field. 
It also runs a xref:search:search-request-params.adoc#numeric-range-queries[Numeric Range Query] on the `brightness` field to only return colors that have a brightness value between `70` and `80`: 

[source,json]
----
include::example$run-hybrid-search-payload-ui.jsonc[]
----

The Search Service combines the Vector search results from a `knn` object with the traditional `query` object by using an `OR` function. 
If the same documents match the `knn` and `query` objects, the Search Service ranks those documents higher in search results.

The document for the color `navy` should be the first result, followed by colors that are similar and match the `brightness` field query. 

[#large]
=== Example: Running a Semantic Search Query with a Large Embedding Vector

The following query searches for matches to a large embedding vector, generated by the https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings[OpenAI embedding model^], `text-embedding-ada-002-v2`.

TIP: You can find generated embedding vectors for each color's `description` field in `rgb.json`.

This query should return the document for the color `navy`, based on a generated embedding vector for:

----
What is a classic, refined hue that exudes elegance and is often linked to power and stability?
----

The following shows part of the sample Search query: 

[source,json]
----
include::example$run-vector-search-long-payload-ui.jsonc[tag=partial]
----
[NOTE]
====
Due to the size of the embedding vector, only part of the full query is being displayed in the documentation. 

Click btn:[View on GitHub] to view and copy the entire Vector Search query payload. 
Make sure you remove the lines for `// tag::partial[]` and `// end::partial[]`.

== Next Steps 

If you do not get the search results you were expecting, you can change the xref:search:search-request-params.adoc[JSON payload for your Search query].
