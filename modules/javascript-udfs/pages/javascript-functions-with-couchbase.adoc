== Introduction

include::partial$javascript-udf-introduction.adoc[]

This reference includes details of external functions using JavaScript.

include::partial$libraries-and-scopes.adoc[]

include::partial$sqlpp-managed-udfs.adoc[]

== Added Constructs

JavaScript functions in {sqlpp} for Query support most of the language constructs available in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript[ECMAScript], though there are a number of restrictions related to the Couchbase environment.
There are also additions that have been made to the language for working specifically with Couchbase.

=== {sqlpp} Embedded Statements

Top level {sqlpp} keywords, such as SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT and DELETE, are available as inline keywords in functions.
Operations that return values such as SELECT are accessible through a returned iterable handle.
{sqlpp} Query results, via a SELECT, are streamed in batches to the iterable handle as the iteration progresses through the result set.

[source, javascript]
----
include::example$select-airline-inline.js[]
----
<1> The {sqlpp} is written directly into the JavaScript code without having to be used as part of a function call.
You can even provide parameters that can be used in the {sqlpp} statement.
<2> A standard JavaScript iterator is used to access the values returned from the {sqlpp} statement.

== Unsupported Features

The following features are unsupported.

=== Browser Extensions

Because JavaScript functions in {sqlpp} for Query do not execute in the context of a browser, the extensions that browsers add to the core language, such as window methods, DOM events etc. are not available.

=== Global State
All variables  must be local to the function; global state is not permitted.

[source, javascript]
----
include::example$illegal-global-variable.js[]
----

Along with global state, global https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions[arrow functions] are not supported.
Arrow functions local to individual JavaScript functions are supported.

=== Logging

Logging using the `console.log(..)` function is not supported.

== Restricted Features

[.status]#Couchbase Server 7.6.2#

The following features are restricted in Couchbase Server 7.6.2 and later.

=== Code Injection

JavaScript constructs that may allow for code injection or speculative execution attacks have been removed:

* The `eval` symbol has been removed.
* The `Function` construct has been removed.

The following example does not compile as it uses the `eval` symbol.

====
[source,javascript]
----
function evaluate() {
    var q = select jscode from <bucket> where meta().id = <docid>;
    let iter = q[Symbol.iterator]();
    let code = iter.next();
    let result = eval(code);
}
----
====

The following example does not compile as it uses the `Function` construct.

====
[source,javascript]
----
function dynamicfunction() {
var q = select jscode from <bucket> where meta().id = <docid>;
    let iter = q[Symbol.iterator]();
    let code = iter.next();
  return new Function("inject", code);
}

function evaluate() {
    dynamicfunction();
}
----
====

=== Date Granularity

The granularity of the `Date` object has been reduced to 1 second.
This is to prevent a potential attacker from easily measuring the difference between a CPU cache miss and cache hit, hence taking advantage of side-channel attacks.

The following example executes a {sqlpp} query to insert a document with a field containing the current timestamp.
The timestamp is returned to the last second, rather than the most recent millisecond.

====
[source,javascript]
----
function addOrder() {
    let curr = Date.now();
    N1QL('INSERT INTO orders VALUES (uuid(),{"time":'+ curr +'})')
}
----
====

The following example simulates sleep by blocking execution by the number of milliseconds passed as a function parameter.
Since the `Date.Now()` function does not return the current time with millisecond granularity, the function may not work as expected.

====
[source,javascript]
----
function sleep(milliseconds) {
  let init = Date.now();
  let curr = null;
  do {
     curr = Date.now();
   } while (curr - init < milliseconds);
}
----
