=== {sqlpp} Managed User-Defined Functions

In Couchbase Server 7.6 and later, you can create the code for an external function and the corresponding {sqlpp} user-defined function in a single operation.
This means that you don't have to specify an external library and create the code for the external function, before creating the {sqlpp} user-defined function.

With a {sqlpp} managed user-defined function, the external function code is stored inline, along with the {sqlpp} user-defined function.
You cannot share this external function code with other user-defined functions, or access it from any external libraries.
