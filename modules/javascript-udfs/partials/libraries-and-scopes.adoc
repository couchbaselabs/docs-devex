=== External Libraries

(((library namespacing)))
You can store JavaScript functions in [.term]#external libraries#.
This enables you to share external function code for use in more than one {sqlpp} user-defined function.
A library can contain one or more JavaScript functions.

You must create the external library and the external function code using the xref:tools:udfs-ui.adoc[Query Workbench] or the {sqlpp} xref:n1ql-rest-api/functions.adoc[Functions REST API].

You do not call the external function code directly from {sqlpp}.
Instead, when you have created an external library and added a JavaScript function to it, you must define a {sqlpp} user-defined function to call the JavaScript function.

// tag::extract[]
External libraries, like {sqlpp} user-defined functions, may be scoped or global.
This enables you to keep the code for external functions separate where required.

.Global and scoped external libraries

* A [.term]#global library# is created within a xref:n1ql:n1ql-intro/queriesandresults.adoc#logical-hierarchy[namespace], at the same level as the buckets within the namespace.

* A [.term]#scoped library# is created within a xref:n1ql:n1ql-intro/queriesandresults.adoc#logical-hierarchy[scope], at the same level as the collections within a scope.

You can apply access restrictions to scopes, so that only certain groups of users will be able to access collections and libraries within that scope.

// tag::extract[]
Code which is stored in a scoped library is private to users of that scope, and is not visible or available to users of another scope.
Code which is stored in a global library is available to users of all scopes.

A global library may have the same name as a scoped library, and scoped libraries may have the same name as each other.
For example, you may have a global `math` library, and a `math` library in each scope.

.Calling a function in a scoped external library

In order to use a {sqlpp} user-defined function which calls external JavaScript code in a scoped library, you must set the xref:n1ql:n1ql-intro/queriesandresults.adoc#query-context[query context] to the same bucket and scope as the scoped library.
