There are two types of user-defined function in {sqlpp} for Query:

* [.term]#Inline functions# are defined using {sqlpp} expressions.
They enable you to name and reuse complex or repetitive expressions, including subqueries, in order to simplify your queries.

* [.term]#External functions# are defined using an external language.
They enable you to create functions that may be difficult or impossible to define using built-in {sqlpp} expressions.
The only supported language is JavaScript.
